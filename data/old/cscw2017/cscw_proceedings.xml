      <abstract>Due to language deficiencies, individual non-native speakers (NNS) face many difficulties while writing. In this paper, we propose to build a collaborative editing system that aims to facilitate the sharing of language knowledge among non-native co-authors, with the ultimate goal of improving writing quality. We describe CEPT, which allows individual co-authors to generate their own revisions as well as incorporating edits from others to achieve mutual inspiration. The main technical challenge is how to aggregate edits of multiple co-authors and present them in an easy-to-understand way. After iterative design, CEPT highlights three novel features: 1) cross-version sentence mapping for edit tracking, 2) summarization of edits from multiple co-authors, and 3) a collaborative editing interface that enables co-authors to examine, comment on, and borrow edits of others. A preliminary lab study showed that CEPT could significantly improve both the language quality and collaboration experience of NNS writers, due to its efficacy for sharing language knowledge.</abstract>

      <abstract>Learning from captioned foreign language videos is highly effective, but the availability of such videos is limited. By using speech-to-text technology to generate partially correct transcripts as a starting point, we see an opportunity for learners to build accurate foreign language captions while learning at the same time. We present a system where learners
correct captions using automatic transcription and machine-generated suggested alternative words for scaffolding. In a lab study of 49 participants, we found that compared to watching the video with accurate caption, learning and quality of experience were not significantly impaired by the secondary caption correction task using interface designs either
with or without scaffolding from speech-to-text generated alternative words. Nevertheless, aggregating corrections reduced word error rate from 19% to 5.5% without scaffolding from suggested-alternatives, and 1.8% with scaffolding. Feedback from participants suggest that emphasizing the learning community contribution aspect is important for motivating learners and reducing frustration.</abstract>

      <abstract>The meaning we attribute to another’s actions significantly impact our subsequent behaviors and interactions towards that person. Distributed teams often combine native speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS) and are particularly prone to making attribution errors. Language difficulties place NNS under a higher cognitive load, potentially leading NS to make inaccurate attributions of NNS. We conducted an exploratory laboratory study to investigate the attributions NS and NNS form about each other in multiparty videoconferencing. Our findings revealed significant mismatches in NS’ attributions of NNS behavior, but no significant mismatch in NNS’ attributions of NS behavior. Due to cognitive overload stemming from language challenges, NNS were only able to engage in “compromised” impression management during the task. Yet, NS were relatively unaware of how profoundly language difficulties impacted NNS’ behaviors. Our findings identify opportunities for technology support for NS-NNS interactions, particularly with regards to impression construction and impression management.</abstract>

      <abstract>In multilingual communication through a common language among both native speakers (NS) and non-native speakers (NNS), NNS may encounter problems in comprehending the messages of NS or following conversations. Even though automated speech recognition (ASR) transcripts provide support to NNS, such transcripts may contain errors and impose the need to simultaneously listen and read. To reduce this burden, we propose adding another channel (i.e., highlighting) through which NS can help NNS by highlighting the critical parts of transcripts, thus making them more useful to NNS. In a laboratory study involving 14 triads (two NS and one NNS in each triad), participants engaged in collaborative discussions under two conditions: audio conferencing plus ASR transcripts with and without the highlighting function. NS showed various motivations to perform the extra task of highlighting. The highlighting efforts helped NS themselves focus on the discussion and enhanced their task performance while increasing the clarity and comfort perceived by NNS during communication. Having NS generating highlights can benefit both NS and NNS, but in different ways. We discuss the implications for research and design of multilingual collaborative work.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online communities have the potential to be supportive, cruel, or anywhere in between. The development of positive norms for interaction can help users build bonds, grow, and learn. Using millions of messages sent in Twitch chatrooms, we explore the effectiveness of methods for encouraging and discouraging specific behaviors, including taking advantage of imitation effects through setting positive examples and using moderation tools to discourage antisocial behaviors. Consistent with aspects of imitation theory and deterrence theory, users imitated examples of behavior that they saw, and more so for behaviors from high status users. Proactive moderation tools, such as chat modes which restricted the ability to post certain content, proved effective at discouraging spam behaviors, while reactive bans were able to discourage a wider variety of behaviors. This work considers the intersection of tools, authority, and types of behaviors, offering a new frame through which to consider the development of moderation strategies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Social media has increasingly become central to the way billions of people experience news and events, often bypassing journalists---the traditional gatekeepers of breaking news. Naturally, this casts doubt on the credibility of information found on social media. Here we ask: Can the language captured in unfolding Twitter events provide information about the event's credibility? By examining the first large-scale, systematically-tracked credibility corpus of public Twitter messages (66M messages corresponding to 1,377 real-world events over a span of three months), and identifying 15 theoretically grounded linguistic dimensions, we present a parsimonious model that maps language cues to perceived levels of credibility. While not deployable as a standalone model for credibility assessment at present, our results show that certain linguistic categories and their associated phrases are strong predictors surrounding disparate social media events. In other words, the language used by millions of people on Twitter has considerable information about an event's credibility. For example, hedge words and positive emotion words are associated with lower credibility.</abstract>

      <abstract>As an important category of user-generated content (UGC) community, Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) community offers internet users opportunities to ask questions and share knowledge with others. In order to understand how the ratings of knowledge contribution quality correlate with the way knowledge is being shared in discussion threads, the study examines user behaviors and profiles in a large knowledge sharing community, /r/Techsupport, a discussion based Q&amp;A site in Reddit.com concerning internet and technology problems. Negative binomial regressions and negative binomial mixed models are built to investigate the relationships among thread structure, level of user activity, user profiles and the ratings of threads and comments in the community. Results indicate that in the better rated threads, the structures tend to be more centralized with heterogeneous participants discussing the problem at a deeper level. Meanwhile, contributions with good ratings are more likely to be produced by users who are more engaged in commenting behaviors.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper examines how users of social media correct online rumors during crisis events. Focusing on Twitter, we identify different patterns of information correcting behaviors and describe the actions, motivations, rationalizations and experiences of people who exhibited them. To do this, we analyze digital traces across two separate crisis events and interviews of fifteen individuals who generated some of those traces. Salient themes ensuing from this work help us describe: 1) different mechanisms of corrective action with respect to who gets corrected and how; 2) how responsibility is positioned for verifying and correcting information; and 3) how users’ imagined audience influences their corrective strategy. We synthesize these three components into a preliminary model and explore the role of imagined audiences—both who those audiences are and how they react to and interact with shared information—in shaping users’ decisions about whether and how to correct rumors.</abstract>

      <abstract>Interaction designers often have difficulty understanding people's real-world experiences with ubiquitous systems. The automobile is a great example of these challenges, where on-road testing is time-consuming and provides little ability for rapid prototyping of interface behavior. We introduce WoZ Way, a system to connect designers to remote drivers. We use live video, audio, car data, and Wizard of Oz speech and interfaces to enable remote observation and interaction prototyping on the road. Our implementation integrates environmental, system level, and social information to make the invisible visible. We tested across three example deployments highlighting usage in interaction prototyping and observational studies. Our findings illustrate how designers explored the situated experiences of people on the road, and how they experimented with different improvisational Wizard of Oz interactions. WoZ Way is both a design research and a design prototyping tool, which can support the work of interaction designers through naturalistic observations, contextual inquiry, and responsive interaction prototyping.</abstract>

      <abstract>  The use of bots as virtual confederates in online field experiments
  holds extreme promise as a new methodological tool in computational
  social science.  However, this potential tool comes with inherent
  ethical challenges.  Informed consent can be difficult to obtain in
  many cases, and the use of confederates necessarily implies the use
  of deception.  In this work we outline a design space for bots as
  virtual confederates, and we propose a set of guidelines for meeting
  the status quo for ethical experimentation.  We draw upon examples
  from prior work in the CSCW community and the broader social science
  literature for illustration.  While a handful of prior researchers
  have used bots in online experimentation, our work is meant to
  inspire future work in this area and raise awareness of the
  associated ethical issues.</abstract>

      <abstract>Users have played a prominent role as “objects of study” in HCI, CSCW, and HRI (Human-Robot Interaction). Researchers have begun to problematize the asymmetric relationship between technical experts and users. In this paper, we focus on how roboticists—borrowing a term from Steve Woolgar—“configure” their robot users. Instead of focusing on what roboticists think of their robots or what users think of robots, we ask, “What do roboticists think of users?” Utilizing two exercises we call futuristic stories and value index cards, we conducted semi-structured interviews with roboticists to examine their discourse on robotics, robots, and users. We found that roboticists framed users as inevitably transforming from a naïve user to a sensible user equipped to handle their ideal, utilitarian robot. Our findings illustrate that roboticists and designers need to make transparent what forms of future users they desire and expect in their design processes.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we unpack the use of conversational agents, or so-called intelligent personal assistants (IPAs), in multi-party conversation amongst a group of friends while they are socialising in a café. IPAs such as Siri or Google Now can be found on a large proportion of personal smartphones and tablets, and are promoted as ‘natural language’ interfaces. The question we pursue here is how they are actually drawn upon in conversational practice? In our work we examine the use of these IPAs in a mundane and common-place setting and employ an ethnomethodological perspective to draw out the character of the IPA-use in conversation. Additionally, we highlight a number of nuanced practicalities of their use in multi-party settings. By providing a depiction of the nature and methodical practice of their use, we are able to contribute our findings to the design of IPAs.</abstract>

      <abstract>Undergraduate research experiences enhance learning and professional development, but providing effective and scalable research training is often limited by practical implementation and orchestration challenges. This paper introduces Agile Research Studios (ARS)—a socio-technical system that expands research training opportunities by supporting research communities of practice without increasing faculty mentoring resources. ARS integrates and advances professional best practices and organizational designs, principles for forming effective learning communities, and design of social technologies to overcome the orchestration challenge of one faculty researcher mentoring 20 or more students. We present the results of a two-year pilot of the Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) program, which used the ARS model to improve the quality of learning, produce research outcomes, and lower the barrier to participation while increasing the number of students who receive authentic research training.</abstract>

      <abstract>Crowdsourcing systems accomplish large tasks with scale and speed by breaking work down into independent parts. However, many types of complex creative work, such as fiction writing, have remained out of reach for crowds because  work is tightly interdependent: changing one part of a story may trigger changes to the overall plot and vice versa. Taking inspiration from how expert authors write, we propose a technique for achieving interdependent complex goals with crowds. With this technique, the crowd loops between reflection, to select a high-level goal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We embody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical Novel resulted in higher-quality stories than an iterative crowdsourcing workflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level goals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online creative communities allow creators to share their work with a large audience, maximizing opportunities to showcase their work and connect with fans and peers. However, sharing in-progress work can be technically and socially challenging in environments designed for sharing completed pieces. We propose an online creative community where sharing process, rather than showcasing outcomes, is the main method of sharing creative work. Based on this, we present Mosaic---an online community where illustrators share work-in-progress snapshots showing how an artwork was completed from start to finish. In an online deployment and observational study, artists used Mosaic as a vehicle for reflecting on how they can improve their own creative process, developed a social norm of detailed feedback, and became less apprehensive of sharing early versions of artwork. Through Mosaic, we argue that communities oriented around sharing creative process can create a collaborative environment that is beneficial for creative growth.</abstract>

      <abstract>From Harry Potter to American Horror Story, fanfiction is extremely popular among young people. Sites such as Fanfiction.net host millions of stories, with thousands more posted each day. Enthusiasts are sharing their writing and reading stories written by others. Exactly how does a generation known more for videogame expertise than long-form writing become so engaged in reading and writing in these communities? Via a nine-month ethnographic investigation of fanfiction communities that included participant observation, interviews, a thematic analysis of 4,500 reader reviews and an in-depth case study of a discussion group, we found that members of fanfiction communities spontaneously mentor each other in open forums, and that this mentoring builds upon previous interactions in a way that is distinct from traditional forms of mentoring and made possible by the affordances of networked publics. This work extends and develops the theory of distributed mentoring. Our findings illustrate how distributed mentoring supports fanfiction authors as they work to develop their writing skills. We believe distributed mentoring holds potential for supporting learning in a variety of formal and informal learning environments.</abstract>

      <abstract>This study examines heartrate sharing in the context of a trust-building game. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we find that &quot;elevated&quot; (versus “normal”) heartrate of an exchange partner is associated with negative mood attributions and reduced cooperation in a social dilemma game. To investigate how specific our findings are to heartrate (as opposed to some other &quot;elevated&quot; signal collected from the body), we replicate our initial experiment with an unfamiliar biosignal, “skin reflectivity”. We find that both heartrate and the unfamiliar biosignal are associated with negative mood attributions, but we observe a decrease in cooperative behavior only with elevated heartrate. Qualitative results indicate that individuals may learn an association between our unfamiliar biosignal and the cooperative, trusting behavior of their partner. Our findings highlight the role prior beliefs can play in shaping interpretations of a biosignal, while suggesting that designers can, perhaps inadvertently, train users to associate signals with social meanings. We discuss implications for how wearable sensors can mediate social interactions.</abstract>

      <abstract>A growing body of literature addresses the use of Grindr and SCRUFF, location-based networking applications for gay, bisexual, and queer men. This study builds on that work, asking whose sexuality is produced in the design and use of these applications. Drawing from ethnographic research and discourse analysis, we build on analytical frames from science and technology studies, feminist HCI, and sexuality studies, proposing what we call the desiring user: a user whose desires and sexuality are mediated through technological devices in particular ways. In doing so, we demonstrate how the discursive constructions of the user put forth by the creators of Grindr and SCRUFF clash with the lived reality of our rural interlocutors. We address emerging themes in CSCW and HCI related to the construction of sexual subjectivities and social computing in rural settings.</abstract>

      <abstract>People-nearby applications (PNAs), such as Tinder and Badoo, help millions of users to make new social connections everyday. However, little is known about how PNAs support offline interactions or what application features are associated with offline encounters. Research suggests that these applications support the development of social capital, but the forms of social capital are unclear. We conducted interviews with 14 active PNA users to address these questions. Our results suggest that while existing PNA features such as filters, profile photos, and chat support online connections, most participants used non-PNA platforms to build mutual trust before meeting offline. In addition, PNA users developed two forms of social (informal and formal) and cultural capital (incorporated and symbolic). We offer insights into how PNAs and non-PNAs intersect to foster feelings of safety and trust prior to offline meetings, and we propose ways for PNAs to support the exchange of cultural and social capital.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many location-based dating applications allow users to search for potential matches who are physically proximate. A recent mobile dating application, happn, adds a temporal dimension to location-based dating, showing users the number of times that they crossed path with each other, as well as the location of the most recent overlap. We conducted qualitative interviews with 15 happn users to understand how people make sense of crossed paths, and assess the meanings they assign to these location overlaps. Building on Uncertainty Reduction Theory, we show the various outcomes of the crossed paths and how they play a role in uncertainty reduction. In particular, the warranting power of the device-driven location data was accepted as valuable, and generated little concern about misrepresentation. Moreover, people assigned significant meaning to the minimal cues available from the overlap data. In addition, the location overlap data was useful in allowing users to estimate convenience in meeting and establish common ground. On the other hand, concerns of security and recognition by known others persisted in the happn app. Our findings suggest the potential for utilizing location data outside of the domain of online dating.</abstract>

      <abstract>We conducted a structured, qualitative feature analysis of 75 Android mobile apps designed for the purpose of promoting adolescent online safety. Through this analysis we identified 42 unique features that mapped to a theoretically derived conceptual framework of teen online safety strategies balanced between parental control strategies (through monitoring, restriction, and active mediation) and teen self-regulation strategies (through self-monitoring, impulse control, and risk-coping). We found that the apps strongly favored features that promote parental control through monitoring and restricting teens’ online behaviors over teen self-regulation or more communicative and collaborative practices between parents and teens. We use the lens of value sensitive design to discuss the implications of our results and identify opportunities for designing mobile apps for online safety that embed more positive family values.</abstract>

      <abstract>The investment of effort into personal communication can be highly meaningful to people, and has particular significance for the mediation of close relationships. This paper presents qualities of effort investment that are seen to be valuable. Furthermore, we consider how these qualities might sensitise designers of communication technologies to the meaningfulness of effort. We report a qualitative study focusing on individual descriptions of meaningful effort invested into everyday correspondence. We encapsulate our findings in the form of five qualities that characterise valued effort: discretionary investment, personal craft, focused time, responsiveness to the recipient, and challenge to a sender's capacities. Drawing on ideas generated in brainstorming sessions, we present two illustrative concepts for new communication technologies, highlighting how our findings can guide the creation of designed artefacts.</abstract>

      <abstract>Long distance couples face challenges in staying connected and must rely heavily on technology to mediate their relationship.  To provide new ways for couples to virtually ‘be together,’ we explore a futuristic use of video communications technology where it is possible to see through the eyes of a partner at any point in time to more deeply stay connected and share experiences together on a daily basis.  We created a technology probe called In Your Eyes that uses a smartphone and Skype in auto-answer mode. Partners can connect to one another at any time without needing to answer a call. Two couples used the probe for one month. One found it beneficial while the other found it intrusive.  We explore the reasons behind these experiences and show the benefits and pitfalls of anytime, anywhere streaming for long distance couples. Our study provides new ways of thinking about presence and connection over distance where the ability to connect and the intention to do so—even if not acted upon—can create feelings of closeness for some and overconnection for others.</abstract>

      <abstract>Many couples live apart due to work, educational situations,
or frequent travel. While technology can help mediate these
relationships, there is a lack of designs that allow couples to
share a sense of touch over distance. We present a design
case study of a tangible communication system called Flex-
N-Feel—a pair of gloves that allows distance-separated
couples to feel the flexing of their remote partners’ fingers
through vibrotactile sensations on their skin. We evaluated
our design with nine couples where the system was
augmented with either a Skype audio call or a video
connection. Our study showed that participants enjoyed
their conversation more with the gloves, felt more
emotionally connected, and experienced intimate moments
together. Couples used the glove for shared actions, playful
episodes, intimate touches, and to simply feel each other’s
presence. Video was important to aid couples in
understanding each other’s actions. Our results illustrate
that designs focusing on physical touch over distance
should be open to appropriation such that they can augment
existing communication routines and technologies.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a microsociology of Minecraft play based on ethnographic observations of a 40-hour co-located Minecraft camp for 28 low-income and minority children in July 2015, supplemented by usage statistics and follow-up interviews. We consider the equity challenges presented by (1) Minecraft itself and the ecosystem supporting it; (2) the multiplayer server we used, which was founded on principles of ‘connected learning’; and (3) our own attempts to promote equity by providing scheduled access to the game in a computer lab. We were partially successful in overcoming players’ at-home computer access limitations and improving their computer/technical literacy. Still, we found that language literacy, parental abilities and involvement, racial and gender identities, and diverging interests set our campers apart from others on the server. Overall, the in-game invisibility of our campers worked against the equity aims of connected learning and point to broader patterns of bias in games like Minecraft and other communities of/for children. </abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of visualization of code history on peer assessment in computer science education. Peer assessment is found to be an effective learning tool for programming education. While many systems are proposed to support peer assessment in programming education, little effort has been devoted to finding ways to improve the peer assessment by assisting the students to understand the programs they are assessing. We introduce Eliph, a web-based peer assessment system for programming education with code history visualization. Eliph incorporates the visualization of character-level code history, selection-based history tracking and the integration of execution events to assist students in understanding programs written by peers, thereby leading to more effective peer assessment. We evaluate Eliph with an experiment in an undergraduate CS course. We show that visualization of code history has positive effects on promoting higher quality of peer feedback by understanding the intention and thought process.</abstract>

      <abstract>Group activities that use Google Docs for simultaneous collaborative writing and editing are increasingly common in higher education. Although studies show that synchronous collaboration can bring multiple benefits, such as enhanced productivity and writing quality, little is known about these writing practices in classrooms and their impact on students’ writing. Using a mixed method approach, we conducted an empirical study that explores the different styles of synchronous collaboration in 45 Google Docs documents produced by 82 undergraduate students, and how students’ practices affect the specific dimensions of the final text including quality. The results suggest that (a) out of four styles, Divide and Conquer style tended to produce better quality text whereas Main Writer had the lowest quality scores, and that (b) balanced participation and amount of peer editing led to longer texts with higher quality scores for content, evidence, but not organization or mechanics. Given these results, we suggest several design features for collaborative writing systems and propose guidelines for instructional practices.

      <abstract>Firms developing software – and in particular, video game producers – seek to leverage the community of users/developers in enhancing product offering and increasing sales. Despite the practical importance of this phenomena, to date little research has investigated the actual value such communities add aside from few qualitative case studies of successful synergies between commercial enterprises and open-source communities. The objective of this study is to try and quantitatively assess the effectiveness of firms’ efforts to increase sales of their product through inducing community’s co-creation activity. Our empirical investigation focuses on producers of video games and their user/developer ‘modding’ community. An analysis of 45 games reveals that when firms are successful at engaging the community, the value added by the modding community contributes to an increase in sales of the base product. Implications for research on open innovation and for practitioners are discussed. </abstract>

      <abstract>Research suggests that the disclosure of struggles and the connection with sympathetic others are critical during periods of transition. Whereas disclosure has been studied in various contexts, the disclosure strategies of United States (US) veterans transitioning back into civil society has not been explored. Through a qualitative study with 15 veterans re-integrating into civil society, we find that the culture of hyper-masculinity learned and performed during military service leads to challenges to disclosure, or non-disclosure, post-service, negatively impacting how military veterans navigate the transition back into civil society. We explore the disclosure issues and strategies of veterans in both offline and online contexts, finding that veterans used online platforms to navigate the challenges limiting disclosure and connect with supportive resources. We conclude by introducing the concept of delayed disclosure—when people postpone making their struggles known in transition—and provide implications for policy, design and future work to help veterans manage their transitions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent research in CSCW, urban informatics, and sociotechnical systems has proposed new framings and emphases of the city as a locus of research on computing and called for a heightened focus on the entanglements of social policy and design. Yet there are relatively few empirical investigations of actual policy-design entanglements in specific cities, and of those available, non-Western cities are underrepresented. We report an empirical study of the 2010 Taipei International Flora Expo (TIFE) as a case to explore these urban informatics/social computing issues. Specifically, we offer an empirically grounded analysis of design as a mechanism of public futuring and debates, which contributes to a better understanding of “participatory urbanship” [6]; and we do so focusing on a non-Western city, both to ensure a broader representation of urban ways of life and also to de-center Western experiences as the primary basis of urban informatics theory in CSCW. </abstract>

      <abstract>Search systems in online social media sites are frequently used to find information about ongoing events and people. For topics with multiple competing perspectives, such as political events or political candidates, bias in the top ranked results significantly shapes public opinion. However, bias does not emerge from an algorithm alone. It is important to distinguish between the bias that arises from the data that serves as the input to the ranking system and the bias that arises from the ranking system itself. In this paper, we propose a framework to quantify these distinct biases and apply this framework to politics-related queries on Twitter. We found that both the input data and the ranking system contribute significantly to produce varying amounts of bias in the search results and in different ways. We discuss the consequences of these biases and possible mechanisms to signal this bias in social media search systems' interfaces.</abstract>

      <abstract>College students are exposed to a vast amount of information on political and social issues through social media. We studied how college students engage with political and social issues on Facebook in a weeklong study with 50 participants using diary entries and interviews. The interviews revealed a duality of benefits for using Facebook for news and they also revealed challenges of self-presentation around news. Benefits included gaining multiple perspectives and enabling social sense making, providing personal relevance and convenience of access, and the opportunity for social engagement. Impression management and disclosure concerns strongly influence some people to refrain from commenting or sharing news. We discuss the challenges that context collapse poses for Facebook news readers. We suggest design ideas and future directions to encourage more balanced participation with news among college students.</abstract>

      <abstract>We investigate community structure and interaction dynamics in online discussion forums through the lens of quotes, examining four forums of different size, language, and topic. Quote usage appears to have an important role in aiding intra-thread navigation, uncovers a hidden social structure in communities otherwise lacking all explicit signals (from friends and followers to reputations) of today's online social networks, and can be used to fingerprint and characterize both individual users and entire communities.</abstract>

      <abstract>Social media platforms have obtained substantial interest of police to connect with residents. This has encouraged residents to report day-to-day law and order concerns such as traffic congestion, missing people, and harassment by cops on these platforms. In this paper, we study day-to-day concerns shared by residents on social media and police response to such concerns. Based on the input of police experts, we define concerns that require police response and attention, as a serviceable request. We provide insights on six textual attributes that can identify serviceable posts. We find such posts are marked by high negative emotions, more factual, and objective content such as location and time of incidences. We show that police response time varies depending upon the kind of serviceable requests. Our work explores a series of statistical models to predict serviceable posts and its different types. We conclude the paper, discussing the implication of our findings on police practices and design needs for possible technological interventions. These technological interventions will help increase the interactions between police and residents and thereby increasing the well-being and safety of society.

      <abstract>Cultural and gender norms shape how mental illness and therapy are perceived. However, there is a paucity of adequate empirical evidence around gender and cultural dimensions of mental illness. In this paper we situate social media as a &quot;lens&quot; to examine these dimensions. We focus on a large dataset of individuals who self-disclose to have an underlying mental health concern on Twitter. Having identified genuine disclosures in this data via semi-supervised learning, we examine differences in their posts, as measured via linguistic attributes and topic models. Our findings reveal significant differences between the content shared by female and male users, and by users from two western and two majority world countries. Males express higher negativity and lower desire for social support, whereas majority world users demonstrate more inhibition in their expression. We discuss the implications of our work in providing insights into the relationship of gender and culture with mental health, and in the design of gender and culture-aware health interventions.</abstract>

      <abstract>Millions of people regularly report the details of their real-world experiences on social media. This provides an opportunity to observe the outcomes of common and critical situations. Identifying and quantifying these outcomes may provide better decision-support and goal-achievement for individuals, and help policy-makers and scientists better understand important societal phenomena.
We address several open questions about using social media data for open-domain outcome identification: Are the words people are more likely to use after some experience relevant to this experience? How well do these words cover the breadth of outcomes likely to occur for an experience? What kinds of outcomes are discovered? Studying 3-months of Twitter data capturing people who experienced 39 distinct situations across a variety of domains, we find that these outcomes are generally found to be relevant (55-100% on average) and that causally related concepts are more likely to be discovered than conceptual or semantically related concepts.</abstract>

      <abstract>Smartphone notifications provide application-specific information in real-time, but could distract users from in-person social interactions when delivered at inopportune moments. We explore breakpoint-based notification management, in which the smartphone defers notifications until an opportune moment. With a video survey where participants selected appropriate moments for notifications from a video-recorded social interaction, we identify four breakpoint types: long silence, a user leaving the table, others using smartphones, and a user left alone. We introduce a Social Context-Aware smartphone Notification system, SCAN, that uses build-in sensors to detect social context and identifies breakpoints to defer smartphone notifications until a breakpoint. We conducted a controlled study with ten friend groups who had SCAN installed on their smartphones while dining at a restaurant. Results show that SCAN accurately detects breakpoints (precision=92.0%, recall=82.5%), and reduces notification interruptions by 54.1%. Most participants reported that SCAN helped them to focus better on in-person social interaction and found selected breakpoints appropriate.</abstract>

      <abstract>Social networking sites are starting to provide users with services that expose information about their audiences' composition and behavior, such as LinkedIn's 'Who's viewed my profile' feature.  Providing information about content viewers to content publishers, however, raises new privacy concerns for viewers themselves, possibly creating a chilling effect on viewer behavior.  
  
We report on a study of 718 respondents using Mechanical Turk across two surveys to study publishers' (N=402) use and expectations of information about their viewers, and viewers' (N=316) privacy behaviors and concerns in the face of such visibility. Our findings indicate that publishers are generally mindful of viewers' privacy; viewers engage in various self-censorship behaviors in the face of visibility; and in some cases (e.g.,  dating sites) significant gender differences exist about what information respondents felt should be shared with publishers and required of viewers. </abstract>

      <abstract>When social networking sites give users granular control over their privacy settings, the result is that some content across the site is public and some is not. How might this content—or characteristics of users who post publicly versus to a limited audience—be different? If these differences exist, research studies of public content could potentially be introducing systematic bias. Via Mechanical Turk, we asked 1,815 Facebook users to share recent posts. Using qualitative coding and quantitative measures, we characterize and categorize the nature of the content. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze patterns of choices for privacy settings. Contrary to expectations, we find that content type is not a significant predictor of privacy setting; however, some demographics such as gender and age are predictive. Additionally, with consent of participants, we provide a dataset of nearly 9,000 public and non-public Facebook posts. </abstract>

      <abstract>Privacy in Online Social Networks (OSNs) is a dynamic concept, contingent on changes in technology and usage norms. Social influence is a major avenue for adopting online behaviors in general and privacy practices in particular. In this study, we examine how the source of influence affects the perceived behavioral intention to adopt privacy behavior. Our findings are based on a randomized experiment (167 U.S.-based Amazon Mechanical Turk workers) using a custom Facebook application that collects feedback from participants regarding their intention to adopt privacy practices from different types of sources, including authoritative organizations and friends with varying tie strength correlative. Our results show that the source of social influence affects the susceptibility to adopt certain privacy behaviors and that there are different patterns of influence for security and privacy norms. More interestingly, susceptibility is modulated by the privacy perceptions of the user: users with high perceived behavioral control are more susceptible to peer influence. Additionally, we show that the intention to adopt privacy practices is correlated with the intention to further influence other people.

      <abstract>With the recent advances in computer-supported cooperative work systems and increasing popularization of speech-based interfaces, groupware attempting to emulate a knowledgeable participant in a collaborative environment is bound to become a reality in the near future.  In this paper, we present IdeaWall, a real-time system that continuously extracts essential information from a verbal discussion and augments that information with web-search materials. IdeaWall provides combinatorial visual stimuli to the participants to facilitate their creative process. We develop three cognitive strategies, from which a prototype application with three display modes was designed, implemented, and evaluated. The results of the user study with twelve groups show that IdeaWall effectively presents visual cues to facilitate verbal creative collaboration for idea generation and sets the stage for future research on intelligent systems that assist collaborative work.</abstract>

      <abstract>How do designers identify substances as materials to be worked into artifacts? Understanding how designer-material collaborations are instantiated, and the effect of those relations on design expression, helps us understand how artifacts come to be as they are. In the digital environment, the relationship between designer and material is complicated by the ambiguous, abstract nature of digital “substances.” This conceptual essay uses case studies from a design project to trace the role of community values in the materialization of a particular abstraction: a deliberate positioning of the designer’s situated viewpoint. By comparing cases where designers materialize a situated position within the resulting artifact and where designers do not do so, this essay illustrates how community values mediate designer-material collaborations. These case studies also demonstrate the effect of designer-material relations on design expression. The designs that materialize a position structure a more reciprocal, dialogic relationship between designer and user.</abstract>

      <abstract>Critical design is gaining momentum in interaction design, yet little CSCW research has focused on articulating the cooperative potentials of critical design artefacts. We address this gap by reflecting upon a design project aimed at overturning the prevailing narrative regarding dyslexia in Italy. The adversarial propositions embedded in our critical design artefacts challenged the description of dyslexia as a learning disorder putting forward the view of a learning difference. These artefacts demonstrated their capacity to bridge heterogeneous social worlds (those of teachers, children, and parents) into one cooperative entity and mobilise cooperative activism. The contribution to CSCW is two-fold. Firstly, we introduce the cooperative potentials of critical design artefacts; secondly, we propose critical design as a strategy for researchers engaging with cooperative activism.</abstract>

      <abstract>Professional interaction designers and software developers have different trainings and skills, yet they need to closely collaborate to create interactive systems.
We conducted three studies to understand the mismatches between their processes, tools and representations.
Based on 16 interviews, we found that current practices induce unnecessary rework and cause discrepancies between the original design and the implementation.
We identified three key design breakdowns where designers omitted critical details, ignored the presence of edge cases or disregarded technical limitations.
We next observed two face-to-face meetings between designers and developers.
We found that early involvement of the developer helped to mitigate potential design breakdowns but new ones emerged as the project unfolded.
Finally, we ran a participatory design session with two designer/developer pairs.
Both pairs had difficulty representing and communicating pre-existing interactions.
Creating complete interaction descriptions required iterating from individual examples to rule-based representations.
We conclude with implications for designing collaborative tools that facilitate the designer's ability to express and the developer's ability to implement complex interactive systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this work, we present EduFeed, a system that enables preliterate children to explore an algorithmically-mediated social feed of learning exercises, select activities to engage in, and share them with their peers. We deployed EduFeed as a technology probe to three classrooms of ESL students in the first year of elementary school in India who had limited English literacy and limited experience with touchscreen technology. We found that children were able to self-direct their engagement with the system and were initially motivated by digital sharing, while social context surrounding the system in physical space was also important. Based on our design and probe deployment, we reflect on issues relevant to adapting the social feed paradigm to this context, such as ranking algorithms, physicality, immediacy, and bridging physical and digital collaborative experiences.</abstract>

      <abstract>While recent work examines parents and children reading together on tablet computers, the ways in which interactive elements within e-books affect parent-child interaction are not well understood. We examine haptic feedback as a new form of e-book interactivity and analyze how parents and children exploit this dimension when reading together. Results from a laboratory study with 18 parent-child dyads (N=36) reveal that participants reading a haptic e-book talked more about the technology compared to those reading a regular e-book, and this additional talk was a way in which parents elaborated the story narrative. Parents reading a non-haptic e-book, however, engaged in higher rates of expressive behavior (e.g., making sounds, gestures). This suggests that haptic interactivity provides a new resource for parents to draw out the story narrative but may also result in less parent expressivity when reading, both of which have implications for child comprehension and literacy.</abstract>

      <abstract>We examine how teens from an urban area in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States regulate their use of technology. We framed our research using everyday life information seeking theory [43] and information ecologies [35]. Using a survey, audio and photo diary study, creative free response activity, and semi-structured interviews, we examine teens’ perceptions of their everyday life technology use and factors that influence changes in that use, with a focus on understanding non-use, low use, and intentional self-regulation. We describe four factors impacting these practices, including local policies and access, affective factors, life stage and future goals, and relationships. We describe how shifting use practices function in the lives of these teens and discuss the importance of acknowledging teens’ skills and preferences for supporting their technology use management. </abstract>

      <abstract>Past research has shown that parents tend to underestimate the frequency with which their teens experience online risks. However, little is known about whether and how teens communicate with their parents when online risks do occur. In a two-month, web-based diary study of 68 teen-parent pairs, participants provided separate accounts of the teens’ weekly online risk experiences. We found that most teens had little or no communication with their parents regarding their online risk experiences, and parents and teens shared very different perceptions and reactions when risks were reported, helping explain why communication was so poor. We discuss the implications of our results and make recommendations for how researchers and designers may work to improve the state of family communication regarding adolescent online risks in the future.</abstract>

      <abstract>To successfully raise money using crowdfunding, it is important for a campaign to communicate ideas or products effectively to the potential backers. One of the lesser explored but powerful components of a crowdfunding campaign is the campaign video. To better understand how videos affect campaign outcomes, we analyzed videos from 210 Kickstarter campaigns across three different project categories. In a mixed-methods study,  we asked 3150 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) workers to evaluate the campaign videos. We found six recurrent factors from a qualitative analysis as well as quantitative analysis. Analysis revealed product related and video related factors that were predictive of the final outcome of campaigns over and above the static project representation features identified in previous studies. Both the qualitative and quantitative analysis showed that videos influenced perception differently for projects in different categories, and the differential perception was important for predicting successes of the projects. For example, in technology campaigns, projects perceived to have a lower level of complexity were more likely to be successful; but in design and fashion campaigns, projects perceived to have a higher level of complexity - which perhaps reflected craftsmanship - were more likely to be successful. We conclude with design implications to better support the video making process.</abstract>

      <abstract>Danmaku is an emerging socio-digital media paradigm that puts anonymous, asynchronous user-generated scrolling comments on videos. (How) can danmaku afford the illusion and realization of social interactions, if at all possible given its interactional incoherence nature? To answer this question, we collect Chinese danmaku users’ reflection on their motivations to use this social service and explore the actual practices that meet the needs. According to a preliminary danmaku usage survey, users consider it as an information seeking and emotion venting channel. Through archival analysis of real-world data, we find that danmaku commentaries are relatively short, video-centric, saturated with emotions, and similar in syntactic and semantic features. Users have developed a set of mechanisms adapted to the medium, to leverage such text-based messages to foster interpersonal and hyperpersonal communication for sharing of facts, thoughts, and feelings.</abstract>

      <abstract>In order to better understand social aspects of the short-form video watching experience, we investigated the journey to co-watching, from searching and discovering content, to choosing and experiencing videos with others. After identifying, through a large-scale survey, some of the most typical situations that bring people to YouTube, we deployed a one week-long diary study with 12 participants in which they performed a set of frequent video tasks at their leisure, half by themselves, and half with someone else. Following the diary study, we had participants reenact the diary study tasks remotely with the experimenter. We observed that users face multiple challenges on the journey to co-watching a video. They must share a device designed for an individual, use different methods for selecting videos than when by themselves, negotiate or turn-take in order to make a decision, and potentially watch a video that they do not enjoy. Along this journey, users must engage in impression management to consider how their choices might make them appear to others. We present design recommendations for remote and collocated co-watching to improve the social video watching experience.</abstract>

      <abstract>People increasingly turn to social media to augment their broadcast viewing experience with a parallel stream of information and opinion. Known as “social watching,” the practice of integrating broadcast media and social media has become routine for many citizens tracking live events and breaking news. In a controlled laboratory study, we examined how interactivity and exposure to social media opinions influence a sense of community, attitudes and discussion elaboration. The results suggest that receiving positive feedback to social media posts instills a psychological sense of community in the poster, and this feeling of connectedness is related to greater elaboration of the civic social media discussion. Secondly, the study found support for conformity effects. The third contribution of this work is a better understanding of how the valence of others’ social media posts and the user’s posting activity influences cognitive elaboration of social media discussions during social watching in civic contexts. </abstract>

      <abstract>Current research demonstrates that when people engage in social photo sharing, they are mindful of how audiences perceive and interact with their photos. We extend this vein of inquiry to focus on photo sharing in the context of the Arab Gulf. We provide insight into how this activity is practiced in a region governed by strict adherence to cultural norms and Islamic traditions that dictate how to “appropriately” share content in digital settings. In particular, we look at the relationship between photo sharing and its effects on identity and self-presentation. To understand how Saudi and Qatari participants represent themselves through photo sharing applications, we conducted 42 face-to-face interviews. Our results reveal that Arab Gulf users engage in photo sharing practices that construct a collective self, distinct from an autonomous self. This collective self often trumps the autonomous self in shaping photo sharing practices.

      <abstract>High context societies are defined by their strong interpersonal relationships, where upholding the shared values of the community, writ large, are of the utmost importance. That is, they prioritize collective identity over individual identity. Through a qualitative case study drawing from a set of 90 semi-structured interviews with Iraqi citizens who were living in Iraq during the 2nd Gulf War, we show how through ICT uses and appropriation, people shape, or influence, social complexities within high context societies. We found that people appropriated ICTs in a way such that they could “save face” and manage other people’s impressions of themselves and, in turn, maintain a positive collective identity. We then explore the use and appropriation of ICTs for impression management in high context societies as a complex process—one that is both social and technical—introduce the notion of technological imperialism, and develop a model of face saving practices that takes collective identity into account.</abstract>

      <abstract>When people share updates with their friends on Facebook they have varying expectations for the feedback they will receive. In this study, we quantitatively examine the factors contributing to feedback expectations and the potential outcomes of expectation fulfillment. We conducted two sets of surveys: one asking people about their feedback expectations immediately after posting on Facebook and the other asking how the amount of feedback received on a post matched the participant's expectations. Participants were more likely to expect feedback on content they evaluated as more important, and to a lesser extent more personal. Expectations also depended on participants' age, gender, and level of activity on Facebook. When asked about feedback expectations from specific friends, participants were more likely to expect feedback from closer friends, but expectations varied considerably based on recency of communication, geographical proximity, and the type of relationship (e.g. family, co-worker). Finally, receiving more feedback relative to expectations correlated with a greater feeling of connectedness to one's Facebook friends. The findings suggest implications for the theory and the design of social network sites. </abstract>

      <abstract>The popularity of social media platforms today makes them an important venue for self-presentation, but the unique affordances of these platforms challenge our existing models for understanding self-presentation behavior. In particular, social media provide multiple platforms on which the self may be presented, expand the role other individuals can play in one’s own self-presentation, and expand the audience while often simultaneously providing less information about who is in that audience. This paper presents an affordance-based approach to self-presentation on social media platforms rooted in these three challenges and presents a systematic taxonomy for considering aspects of platforms that affect self-presentation. Results from an exploratory study of 193 users suggest significant variation in user perception of our proposed affordances across social media platforms, participant experience levels, and participant personality traits.</abstract>

      <abstract>Information and Communications Technology (ICT) affords new opportunities for people with disabilities to participate in the workforce. However, little research has investigated how people with disabilities access and perform work through ICT. This paper presents a study of how people with disabilities, particularly those who are wheelchair users, perform online crowd work in China. We highlight an online crowd work practice that is highly embedded in social relationships that are developed through ICT over time. We call this socially embedded work to distinguish it from previous studies describing online crowd work as being devoid of social relationships. Our study uncovers the unique developmental dynamics of the online crowd work community self-organized by wheelchair users in China. Findings suggest that an ecosystem that focuses on fostering social relationships among the stakeholders can potentially address the wide range of issues of online crowd work reported in current crowd work literature.</abstract>

      <abstract>Ageism is a pervasive, and often invisible, form of discrimination. Though it can affect people of all ages, older adults in particular face age-related stereotypes and bias in their everyday lives. In this paper, we describe the ways in which older bloggers articulate a collective narrative on ageism as it appears in their lives, develop a community with anti-ageist interests, and discuss strategies to navigate and change societal views and institutions. Bloggers criticize stereotypical notions that focus exclusively on losses that occur with age and advocate a view that takes into account the complexity and positive aspects of older adulthood. This paper contributes a unique case of online collective action among older adults while drawing on their online discourse as a way of understanding what ageism means for CSCW. </abstract>

      <abstract>Deaf individuals often experience communication difficulties in face-to-face interactions with hearing people. In order to support deaf individuals in such situations, an active stream of assistive technology (AT) research focuses on real-time translation of sign language. We investigate the impact of real-time translation-based ATs on communication quality between deaf and hearing individuals. We conducted a focus group and aWizard of Oz study in which deaf and hearing participants jointly interacted with different assistive technologies. We find that while ATs facilitate communication, communication quality is degraded by to breaks in the conversation. Using Co-Cultural Theory, we identify deaf people as a subordinate group inside a hearing society. Our results indicate that current ATs reinforce this subordination by emphasizing deficiency of mastering the dominant form of communication. Based on our findings, we propose a change in design perspective by enabling the hearing to sign rather than the deaf to “hear”. We argue that ATs should not be seen as “just” a tool for the Deaf but rather as a collaborative technology.</abstract>

      <abstract>Gaze-based alternative and augmentative communication (AAC) devices provide users with neuromuscular diseases the ability to communicate with other people through only the movement of their eyes. These devices suffer from slow input, causing a host of communication breakdowns to occur during face-to-face conversations. These breakdowns lead to decreased user autonomy, conversation quality, and communication partner engagement. Attempts to improve communication through these devices has mainly focused on throughput and rate enhancement, though this has only attained meager results to date. In this work, we address this issue from the top down by considering AAC devices as a form of groupware and designing interactions around this groupware that facilitate better conversations for all involved communicators. We first present qualitative findings on issues with gaze-based AAC and end-user communication preferences; we identify several design guidelines for improving these systems and then present AACrobat, a system that embodies these guidelines and introduces novel interactions by extending gaze-based AAC devices with a mobile companion app. Finally, we present early feedback on AACrobat through three case studies of users with ALS.</abstract>

      <abstract>Since the establishment of Computer Supported Collaborative Work as a research area, computer advances have change the paradigm of how technology is applied to improve the performance in collaborative scenarios.  Notifications are an important part of this improvement. Technological systems have been applied in order to provide collaborators with the sufficient awareness to keep a task going. In this paper we present the protocol and results of a Systematic Literature Review that delves in the application of new technologies to provide awareness in collaborative systems. Moreover, we classify the collaborative systems found in literature using two traditional taxonomies for CSCW in order to understand which notification mechanisms are used to support which systems. Our review covers the last 10 years and classifies system prototypes based on the context in which they are applied, the notification and information gathering mechanism used, and the assessment performed. With over 400 papers reviewed, 83 that met the review requirements were included. The review results show that traditional interfaces and mobile devices are still the most common notification mechanisms. However, ubiquitous devices and non-traditional interfaces have also been used.</abstract>

      <abstract>The field of web archiving provides a unique mix of human and automated agents collaborating to achieve the preservation of the web. Centuries old theories of archival appraisal are being transplanted into the sociotechnical environment of the World Wide Web with varying degrees of success. The work of the archivist and bots in contact with the material of the web present a distinctive and understudied CSCW shaped problem. To investigate this space we conducted semi-structured interviews with archivists and technologists who were directly involved in the selection of content from the web for archives. These semi-structured interviews identified thematic areas that inform the appraisal process in web archives, some of which are encoded in heuristics and algorithms. Making the infrastructure of web archives legible to the archivist, the automated agents and the future researcher is presented as a challenge to the CSCW and archival community.</abstract>

      <abstract>The democratization of data science and open government data initiatives are inspiring groups from civic hackers to data journalists to use data to address social issues. The analysis of open government data is expected to encourage citizens to participate in government as well as to improve transparency and efficiency in government processes. Through interviews and survey responses we gathered information on forty projects that involved the analysis of open data. We found that collaborations were interdisciplinary, small in scale, with low turnover, and synchronous communication. Most of the projects asked exploratory questions and made use of descriptive statistics and visualizations. We discuss how these findings contribute to an understanding of the emerging practice of open data analysis and to a broader understanding of open collaboration.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present results of a qualitative study of the information systems used by college and university food banks and find that their inventory systems are characterized by the patchwork use of multiple units of measurement—currencies—collected at different points in their workflow for different stakeholders. Considerations of whether to track information by item count, points, monetary value, or weight are immensely political and privilege some stakeholders over others. We contribute to an emergent body of research in computer-supported cooperative work about the ways in which the politics of measurement influences the design of organizational information systems through an explanation of the ways that these different currencies embody politics and stymie design at the most mundane level of the information system—the unit of measurement.

      <abstract>Collective intelligence (CI), a group’s capacity to perform a wide variety of tasks, is a key factor in successful collaboration. Group composition, particularly diversity and member social perceptiveness, are consistent predictors of CI, but we have limited knowledge about the mechanisms underlying their effects. To address this gap, we examine how physiological synchrony, as an indicator of coordination and rapport, relates to CI in computer-mediated teams, and if synchrony might serve as a mechanism explaining the effect of group composition on CI. We present results from a laboratory experiment where 60 dyads completed the Test of Collective Intelligence (TCI) together online and rated their group satisfaction, while wearing physiological sensors. We find that synchrony in facial expressions (indicative of shared experience) was associated with CI and synchrony in skin conductance (indicative of shared arousal) with group satisfaction. Furthermore, various forms of synchrony mediated the effect of member diversity and social perceptiveness on CI and group satisfaction.  Our results have important implications for online collaborations and distributed teams.</abstract>

      <abstract>Microtask crowdsourcing is increasingly critical to the creation of extremely large datasets. As a result, crowd workers spend weeks or months repeating the exact same tasks, making it necessary to understand their behavior over these long periods of time. We utilize three large, longitudinal datasets of nine million annotations collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk to examine claims that workers fatigue or satisfice over these long periods, producing lower quality work. We find that, contrary to these claims, workers are extremely stable in their quality over the entire period. To understand whether workers set their quality based on the task's requirements for acceptance, we then perform an experiment where we vary the required quality for a large crowdsourcing task. Workers did not adjust their quality based on the acceptance threshold: workers who were above the threshold continued working at their usual quality level, and workers below the threshold self-selected themselves out of the task. Capitalizing on this consistency, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict workers' long-term quality using just a glimpse of their quality on the first five tasks.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper establishes the power of dynamic collaborative task completion among workers for urban mobile crowd-sourcing. Collaboration is defined via the notion of peer referrals, whereby a worker who has accepted a location-specific task, but is unlikely to visit that location, offloads the task to a willing friend. Such a collaborative framework might be particularly useful for task bundles, especially for bundles that have higher geographic dispersion. The challenge, however, comes from the high similarity observed in the spatio-temporal pattern of task completion among friends. Using extensive real-world crowd-sourcing studies conducted over 7 weeks and 1000+ workers on a campus-based crowd-sourcing platform, we quantify the effect of such &quot;task completion homophily&quot;, and show that incorporating such peer-preferences can improve worker-specific models of task preferences by over 30%. We then show that such collaborative offloading works in spite of such spatio-temporal similarity, primarily because workers refer tasks to their close friends, who in turn perform such peer-requested tasks (with over 95% completion rate) even if they experience detours that are significantly larger (often more than twice) than what they normally tolerate for platform-recommended tasks.</abstract>

      <abstract>Targeted responder model is a recent approach in providing initial treatment to cardiac arrest patients. In this model, a group of trained responders are dispatched via mobile devices to nearby cardiac arrests. While prior work shows that targeted responder programs are successful in reducing average response time, less than a quarter of the responders who receive the notification of a nearby cardiac arrest travel to the scene of event. This study is an attempt to better understand barriers to respond in targeted responder programs. We conducted a weeklong diary study and focus groups with 12 participants. We identified four categories of barriers that emerge and we discussed the design implications of our findings within the broader context of location-based crowdsourcing.</abstract>

      <abstract>We designed a communication system for law enforcement officers to use when conducting explosive detection searches with multiple agencies. Dogs trained in explosive detection work alongside human handlers to form a K9 team, which are an integral part of these searches. Officers in K9 teams have a strong bond and communication with these dogs, but noisy locations, long distances, and crowded spaces present challenges. In addition, other officers assigned as backup often lack the experience to read the cues from the canine, which hinders the speed and effectiveness of the team. Coordinating a search with teams from different municipalities presents challenges due to a lack of standard collaboration tools. Getting the right information as quickly as possible saves lives, whether this information is about the areas that have been searched or the location of an explosive device. We hope that in addition to increasing public safety, our system will make working conditions safer for law enforcement officers and their canines.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper investigates coordination and real-time information sharing across four emergency medical teams in a high-risk and distributed setting as they provide care to critically injured patients within the first hour after injury. Through multiple field studies we explored how common understanding of critical patient data is established across these heterogeneous teams and what coordination mechanisms are being used to support information sharing and interpretation. To interpret the data, we drew on the concept of Common Information Spaces (CIS). Our results showed that teams faced many challenges in achieving efficient information sharing and coordination, including difficulties in locating and assembling team members, communicating and interpreting information from the field, and reconciling differences in team perspectives and information needs, all while having minimal technology support. We reflect on these challenges to suggest an extension of the classic CSCW time-space matrix, as well as future development of CIS as an analytical framework. The paper concludes with design opportunities for supporting highly distributed and heterogeneous teamwork in time-critical work environments.</abstract>

      <abstract>Collaboration is a core component of work activities amongst flight attendants as they work to promote onboard safety and a high level of customer service. Yet we know little of how flight attendants collaborate and whether or not technology adequately supports their practices. Through an interview study with flight attendants, we explored their collaborative practices and processes and how technology aided such practices. While technologies like interphones and flight attendant call buttons acted as collaboration tools, we identified instances where the usability and functionality of these devices were the main barriers for maintaining efficient communication, situation awareness, and information exchange. Our findings inform the design of future technologies for enhancing communication and collaboration in an aircraft setting amongst flight attendants with an emphasis on real time information access and direct communication between flight attendants regardless of their location.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent CSCW research has shown that nomadicity can be seen as a dynamic process that emerges as people engage with practices supporting them in the mobilisation of their workplace to accomplish work in and across different locations. This paper elaborates on the emergent aspects of the process by detailing a spectrum of motivational and contextual forces that surround and shape nomadic practices. The paper contributes to existing CSCW literature on nomadicity and extends it by articulating the complex intersections of motive and context that shape nomadic practices. The findings that the paper presents emerged from an ethnographic study of a group of academics and their nomadic work/life practices.</abstract>

      <abstract>Enterprise social networking (ESN) platforms have been implemented by organizations to support employees’ collaboration. However, there has been a reported lack of user participation on these platforms. This study focuses on interventions that can be used to overcome barriers of usage. A case study was conducted at IBM to investigate the effect of several interventions to positively influence ESN acceptance within IBM’s Human Resources (HR) function. In this study we combined two rounds of interview data with activity log data. We interviewed the initiators of interventions, and we interviewed the employees targeted by those interventions. The activity logs allowed us to contrast actual usage of the ESN by employees from HR vs. other organizational functions. Compared to other ESN studies this study explicitly identifies factors driving or inhibiting ESN use, and shows how these factors can be addressed by interventions to significantly increase ESN use. Our results can inform and enable other organizations interested in the design of interventions to increase the use of ESN.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we use results from two ethnographic studies of the music production process to examine some key issues regarding how work is currently accomplished in studio production environments. These issues relate in particular to workflows and how metadata is adapted to the specific needs of specific parts of the process. We find that there can be significant tensions between how reasoning is applied to metadata at different stages of production and that this can lead to overheads where metadata has to be either changed or created anew to make the process work. On the basis of these findings we articulate some of the potential solutions we are now examining. These centre in particular upon the notions of Digital/Dynamic Musical Objects and flexible metadata shells.</abstract>

      <abstract>Request management occurs at an intersection of CSCW and personal information management (i.e., to-do management), with particular emphasis on social relationships and organizational accountability. We explore diverse work practices and representations for person-to-person requests in organizations, detailing the scatter of communications channels, difficulty of aggregation and prioritization, differences due to context, and the sometimes extraordinary effort and passion that knowledge workers expend on this part of their work, as well as the compassion with which they view their colleagues’ efforts. We close with a proposal for the study of socially implicated objects in physical and/or virtual organizations, and implications for the design of services to support request management.</abstract>

      <abstract>Feedback is information that can improve task performance. Online communities, educational forums, and crowd-based feedback platforms all support feedback exchange among a more diverse set of sources than ever before, with greater control over how to moderate this exchange. In this work, we study how the power relationship between the source and receiver and the tone of language influence the recep-tivity, effort, and work performance resulting from online feedback exchange. We conducted an online experiment manipulating affective language and source of feedback on a writing task. We found that critiques with positive affec-tive language increased positive emotions and reduced participants’ annoyance and frustration, which led to an increase in work quality, compared to critiques without positive language. Feedback without positive affective language led to more edits, but not better work outcomes. Participants reacted more positively to feedback from an anonymous source than from a peer or an authority. Our findings provide design implications for platforms to support more fruitful feedback exchange.</abstract>

      <abstract>How do individuals perceive algorithmic vs. group-made decisions? We investigated people’s perceptions of mathematically-proven fair division algorithms making social division decisions. In our first qualitative study, about one third of the participants perceived algorithmic decisions as less than fair (30% for self, 36% for group), often because algorithmic assumptions about users did not account for multiple concepts of fairness or social behaviors, and the process of quantifying preferences through interfaces was prone to error. In our second experiment, algorithmic decisions were perceived to be less fair than discussion-based decisions, dependent on participants’ interpersonal power and computer programming knowledge. Our work suggests that for algorithmic mediation to be fair, algorithms and their interfaces should account for social and altruistic behaviors that may be difficult to define in mathematical terms.</abstract>

      <abstract>We developed the Model of Regulation to provide a vocabulary for comparing and analyzing collaboration practices and tools in software engineering. This paper discusses the model's ability to capture how individuals self-regulate their own tasks and activities, how they regulate one another, and how they achieve a shared understanding of project goals and tasks. Using the model, we created an “action-oriented” instrument that individuals, teams, and organizations can use to reflect on how they regulate their work and on the various tools they use as part of regulation. We applied this instrument to two industrial software projects, interviewing one or two stakeholders from each project. The model allowed us to identify where certain processes and communication channels worked well, while recognizing friction points, communication breakdowns, and regulation gaps. We believe this model also shows potential for application in other domains.</abstract>

      <abstract>Financial prospectuses, which are available to consumers who buy financial products, are intended to help inform decision-making. While prospectuses provide a wealth of information, they are complex and difficult to understand for the vast majority of their intended readers. To help non-experts make informed decisions, we investigated how social annotations with comparative statements embedded into online prospectuses influence users’ decisions and perceptions about decisions. We recruited 31 pre-study users to annotate 10 retirement saving plan prospectuses. We then embedded these annotations in prospectuses provided to another set of 228 users (147 novices and 81 experts) in a 35-period retirement saving simulation. Novices benefited from exposure to social annotations, and were more likely to meet their retirement saving goals than those not exposed to annotations. Exposure to social annotations brought novices’ performance level to that of experts, but at the same time, led them to lower perceived understanding of the prospectus.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper proposes a novel multi-task allocation framework, named PSAllocator, for participatory sensing (PS). Different from previous single-task oriented approaches, which select an optimal set of users for each single task independently, PSAllocator attempts to coordinate the allocation of multiple tasks to maximize the overall system utility on a multi-task PS platform. Furthermore, PSAllocator takes the maximum number of sensing tasks allowed for each participant and the sensor availability of each mobile device into consideration. PSAllocator utilizes a two-phase offline multi-task allocation approach to achieve the near-optimal goal. First, it predicts the participants’ connections to cell towers and locations based on historical data from the telecom operator; Then, it converts the multi-task allocation problem into the representation of a bipartite graph, and employs an iterative greedy process to optimize the task allocation. Extensive evaluations based on real-world mobility traces show that PSAllocator outperforms the baseline methods under various settings. </abstract>

      <abstract>The human library is an event intended to engage members of the community in sharing and learning from each other's experiences, and is growing in popularity internationally. Human libraries fall within the larger scope of community knowledge sharing but have received little study and remain largely unsupported by technology. In this study, we examine how community libraries organize and host these events. We present how libraries have attempted to utilize technologies and leverage community support to enable human library events. Our findings reveal inconsistencies in the purpose of human library events, as well as technology applications that are not sufficient to support fully collaborative community knowledge building. We highlight opportunities for increased community participation and technological innovation and also suggest a broader consideration of computer-supported collaborative work in the context of human libraries and experience sharing.

      <abstract>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a disease that causes individuals to lose their ability to control their muscles, eventually leaving them unable to speak or write. People with ALS often transition to using an augmentative and alternative communication device (AAC), which requires both the AAC user and their conversation partners to adjust to new and different communication patterns. We conducted interviews with seven individuals with ALS and their partners, focusing on how AAC use has impacted their communication and personal expression. Our participants experienced a range of communication difficulties, including conversational pacing, personality expression, and interacting with unfamiliar conversational partners. Participants worked to adapt their communication behaviors to the AAC device, but still experienced challenges in expressing themselves, and sometimes felt compelled to withdraw from social interaction. By improving our understanding of how people transition to using AAC, we may inform improved designs for future AAC devices.</abstract>

      <abstract>We designed and deployed automatic alt-text (AAT), a system that applies computer vision technology to identify faces, objects, and themes from photos to generate photo alt-text for screen reader users on Facebook. We designed our system through iterations of prototyping and in-lab user studies. Our lab test participants had a positive reaction to our system and an enhanced experience with Facebook photos. We also evaluated our system through a two-week field study as part of the Facebook iOS app for 9K VoiceOver users. We randomly assigned them into control and test groups and collected two weeks of activity data and their survey feedback. The test group reported that photos on Facebook were easier to interpret and more engaging, and found Facebook more useful in general. Our system demonstrates that artificial intelligence can be used to enhance the experience for visually impaired users on social networking sites (SNSs), while also revealing the challenges with designing automated assistive technology in a SNS context.

      <abstract>Networked gatekeepers on social media increasingly influence which people and groups receive media attention. Many unknowingly direct much greater attention to men than to women. Can technologies support these gatekeepers to follow their own values of equality? Theories of value consistency suggest that confronting people with inconsistencies between values and behavior can prompt behavior change. In this paper, we introduce FollowBias, a novel system that offers feedback on the percentage of women that users follow onTwitter. We conduct field deployments of FollowBias with 61 and 78 participants, exploring differences between their values and behavior, their explanations of those differences, and their changes in behavior. In the first, FollowBias users had a 45 percentage point greater chance of increasing the percentage of women followed over one week. In the second, we fail to find an effect. We also offer findings on political and ethical trade-offs in designing systems for behavior change toward equality.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online document collaboration tools, such as Google Docs, offer designers different ways of communicating and working collaboratively compared to face-to-face interaction. In this paper, we attempt to explore the possibilities and limitations of using an online document collaboration tool for design problem-solving activities. A design workshop study was conducted to compare using Google Docs during a design task to face-to-face collaboration. As a result, we found different influences of exploiting an online document collaboration tool and face-to-face interaction on the design process, and identified the properties that afford different characteristics of design problem-solving activity. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of using an online document collaboration tool and face-to-face interaction for collaborative design.</abstract>

      <abstract>Prior research shows that the social construction of gender evolves in relation to specific economic and social processes. This paper examines how the practice of DIY (do-it-yourself) making has become a productive frame for a collective of fathers in the U.S. to express masculinity, amidst increasingly precarious economics and shifting norms of gender and labor in the home. Drawing from a qualitative interview study with fathers (n=22) and visual analysis of DIY father blogs (n=29), we examine how DIY fatherhood was produced across the material and discursive practices of blogging. This paper contributes an empirical account of a contemporary phenomenon: the construction and performance of DIY practice as a category of fatherhood identity and domestic masculinity. Further, the paper describes how fathers engage in entrepreneurial thinking as a form of domestic male labor. </abstract>

      <abstract>We present a qualitative interview study of 39 participants who describe their current practices and concerns with shaping a digital legacy, especially when they are using cloud-based storage services that unify secure file storage and password management functionalities in one service (electronic data safes). After introducing the transactional model of stress and coping as an analytical lens, we report on the users’ coping strategies with respect to shaping and giving access to their digital legacy. Pre-mortem password sharing is identified as a common problem-focused coping strategy. Moreover, emotion-focused strategies of avoid-ance and ignorance are discussed. Challenges associated with passing on a digital legacy, such as the lack of enculturated practices, difficulties in the appraisal and selection of information items, the preference for deletion, and implicitly transferring data stewardship duties are described and discussed to develop design implications. </abstract>

      <abstract>Social identities carry widely agreed upon meanings, called stereotypes, that have important effects on social processes. In the present work, we develop a method to extract the stereotypes of Twitter users. Our method is grounded in two distinct strands of theory, one that represents stereotypes as identities' affective meanings and the other that represents stereotypes as semantic relationships between identities. After validating our approach via a prediction task, we apply the model to a dataset of 45 thousand Twitter users who actively tweeted about the Michael Brown and Eric Garner tragedies. Our work provides unique insights into the stereotypes of these users, as well as providing a way of quantifying stereotypes that blends existing sociological and psychological theory in a novel, parsimonious way.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online communities dedicated to the creation of fanworks (e.g., fiction or art inspired by media such as books or television shows) often serve as communities of practice for learning communication, artistic, and technical skills. In studying one successful fan fiction archive that was designed and built entirely by (predominantly women) fans, we observed processes of legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) in which some of these fans began in peripheral roles and came to be more involved in the technical aspects of the archive over time. In addition to outlining positive outcomes, we discuss the challenges of supporting learning within this CoP, particularly with respect to the burden on experts. We discuss potential implications and solutions for the problem of expert scarcity in CoPs, and propose that LPP within fan communities can be leveraged for broadening participation in computing among women.</abstract>

      <abstract>With fewer than 66% of eligible voters registered and voter turnout rates 5-14 percentage points lower than any other ethnic group, Native Americans comprise the least participatory ethnic group in U.S. political elections [42, 57, 49, 25]. While discourse surrounding Native American issues and interests has increasingly moved to social media [55, 56], there is a lack of data about Native American political discourse on these platforms. Given the heterogeneity of Native American peoples in the U.S., one way to begin approaching a holistic understanding of Native American political discourse on social media is to characterize how Native American advocates utilize social media platforms for connective action. Using a post-structural, interdisciplinary, mixed methods approach, we use theories of connective action [5] and media richness [14] to analyze a Twitter data set culled from influential Native American advocates and their followers during the 2016 primary presidential election season. Our study sheds light on how Native American advocates use social media to propagate political information and identifies which issues are central to the political discourse of Native American advocates. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the bandwidth characteristics of content impact its propagation and we discuss this in the context of pernicious digital divide effects present in Indian Country.</abstract>

      <abstract>Social movements use social computing systems to complement offline mobilizations, but prior literature has focused almost exclusively on movement actors' use of social media. In this paper, we analyze participation and attention to topics connected with the Black Lives Matter movement in the English language version of Wikipedia between 2014 and 2016. Our results point to the use of Wikipedia to (1) intensively document and connect historical and contemporary events, (2) collaboratively migrate activity to support coverage of new events, and (3) dynamically re-appraise pre-existing knowledge in the aftermath of new events. These findings reveal patterns of behavior that complement theories of collective memory and collective action and help explain how social computing systems can encode and retrieve knowledge about social movements as they unfold.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper, we describe how people perceive the use of social media to support crime prevention in their communities. Based on survey and interview data from residents in high- and low-crime neighborhoods in Chicago, we found that African Americans, people from high-crime neighborhoods, and people with low levels of trust in local police are less likely to view social media as an appropriate tool to support citizens or the police in local crime prevention efforts. Residents' concerns include information getting into the wrong hands, trolls, and being perceived as a snitch. Despite concerns with usage, citizens also viewed social media as a tool that can supplement in-person crime prevention efforts and facilitate relationship-building and information sharing. We discuss the complexities of hyper-local usage of social media to combat crime by describing the social and historical contexts in which these tools exist. </abstract>

      <abstract>This exploratory work studies the effects of emerging app features on the cyberbullying practices in high school settings. These include the increasing prevalence of image/video content, perceived ephemerality, anonymity, and hyperlocal communication. Based on qualitative analysis of focus groups and follow-up individual interviews with high school students, these features were found to influence the practice of cyberbullying, as well as creating negative socio-psychological effects. For example, visual data was found to be used in cyberbullying settings as evidence of contentious events, a repeated reminder, and caused a graphic impact on recipients. Similarly, perceived ephemerality of content was found to be associated with ``broken expectations'' with respect to the apps and severe bullying outcomes for those affected. Results shed light on an important technology-mediated social phenomenon of cyberbullying, improve understanding of app use (and abuse) by the teenage user population, and pave the way for future research on countering app-centric cyberbullying.   </abstract>

      <abstract>In online communities, antisocial behavior such as trolling disrupts constructive discussion.
While prior work suggests that trolling behavior is confined to a vocal and antisocial minority, we demonstrate that ordinary people can engage in such behavior as well.
We propose two primary trigger mechanisms: the individual's mood, and the surrounding context of a discussion (e.g., exposure to prior trolling behavior).
Through an experiment simulating an online discussion, we find that both negative mood and seeing troll posts by others significantly increases the probability of a user trolling, and together double this probability.
To support and extend these results, we study how these same mechanisms play out in the wild via a data-driven, longitudinal analysis of a large online news discussion community.
This analysis exposes temporal mood effects, and explores long range patterns of repeated exposure to trolling.
A predictive model of trolling behavior reveals that mood and discussion context together can
explain trolling behavior better than an individual's history of trolling.
These results combine to suggest that ordinary people can, under the right circumstances, behave like trolls.</abstract>

      <abstract>The popularity, availability, and ubiquity of information and communication technologies create new opportunities for online harassment. The present study evaluates factors associated with young adult women’s online harassment experiences through a multi-factor measure accounting for the frequency and severity of negative events. Findings from a survey of 659 undergraduate and graduate students highlight the relationship between harassment, well-being, and engagement in strategies to manage one’s online identity. We further identify differences in harassment experiences across three popular social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We conclude by discussing this study’s contribution to feminist theory and describing five potential design interventions derived from our data that may minimize these negative experiences, mitigate the psychological harm they cause, and provide women with more proactive ways to regain agency when using communication technologies.</abstract>

      <abstract>Ensuring the early detection of important social network users is a challenging task. Some peer ranking services are now well established, such as PeerIndex, Klout, or Kred. Their function is to rank users according to their influence. This notion of influence is however abstract, and the algorithms achieving this ranking are opaque. Following the rising demand for a more transparent web, we
explore the problem of gaining knowledge by reverse engineering such peer ranking services, with regards to the social network topology they get as an input.  Since these services exploit the online activity of users (and therefore their connectivity in social networks), we provide a precise evaluation of how topological metrics of the social network impact the final user ranking.
Our approach is the following: we first model the ranking service as a black-box
with which we interact by creating user profiles and by performing operations on them. Through those profiles, we trigger some slight topological modifications. By monitoring the impact of these modifications on the rankings of those profiles, we infer the weight of each topological metric in the black-box, thus reversing the service influence cookbook.

      <abstract>We present novel research at the intersection of review mining and impact assessment of issue-focused information products, namely documentary films. We develop and evaluate a theoretically grounded classification schema, related codebook, corpus annotation, and prediction model for detecting multiple types of impact that documentaries can have on individuals, such as change versus reaffirmation of behavior, cognition, and emotions, based on user-generated content, i.e., reviews. This work broadens the scope of review mining tasks, which typically comprise the prediction of ratings, helpfulness, and opinions. Our results suggest that documentaries can change or reinforce peoples’ conception of an issue. We perform supervised learning to predict impact on the sentence level by using data driven as well as predefined linguistic, lexical, and psychological features; achieving an accuracy rate of 81% (F1) when using a Random Forest classifier, and 73% with a Support Vector Machine. </abstract>

      <abstract>A thorough understanding of social media discussions and the demographics of the users involved in these discussions has become critical for many applications like business or political analysis. Such an understanding and its ramifications on the real world can be enabled through the automatic summarization of Social Media. Trending topics are offered as a high level content recommendation system where users are suggested to view related content if they deem the displayed topics interesting. However, identifying the characteristics of the users focused on each topic can boost the importance even for topics that might not be popular or bursty. We define a way to characterize groups of users that are focused in such topics and propose an efficient and accurate algorithm to extract such communities. Through qualitative and quantitative experimentation we observe that topics with a strong community focus are interesting and more likely to catch the attention of users.</abstract>

      <abstract>Current recommender systems often show the same most-highly recommended items again and again ignoring the feedback that users neither rate nor click on those items. We conduct an online field experiment to test two ways of manipulating top-N recommendations with the goal of improving user experience: cycling the top-N recommendation based on their past presentation and serpentining the top-N list mixing the best items into later recommendation requests. We find interesting tensions between opt-outs and activities, user perceived accuracy and freshness. Cycling within the same session might be a “love it or hate it” recommender property because users in it have a higher opt-out rate but engage in more activities. Cycling across sessions and serpentining increase user activities without significantly affecting opt-out rates. Users perceive more change and freshness but less accuracy and familiarity. Combining cycling and serpentining does not work as well as each individual manipulation separately. These two ways of manipulations on top-N list demonstrate some attractive properties but also call for innovative approaches to overcome their potential costs.</abstract>

      <abstract>As social media platforms witness more and more contributions from participants during developing crisis events, some platforms provide affordances that support visibility for specific pieces of information. However, the design of information visibility, especially in the context of controlling information flows (through gatekeeping), may shape how participants collect and share up-to-date information in these systems. This paper looks at the field site of reddit.com through trace ethnography methods to understand how the design of reddit’s platform (from algorithms to user roles) impacts the visibility of information and subsequently how participants aggregate information in response to ongoing events. Through trace ethnographic analysis, we illustrate three themes related to tensions around visibility – behavioral, structural, and relational – and show how visibility shapes the work of producing information about crises in social news sites. </abstract>

      <abstract>Nepal was struck by two major earthquakes in April and May 2015 which gave rise to much media attention. Because of photographs’ power to influence how people perceive significant events, we investigate how these disasters are represented visually through Twitter-shared images in three ways. First, we compare how geotagged image tweets are distributed vis-à-vis the reported damage, to see if a seemingly “objective” method of representation stands up. Second, with an iteratively developed coding scheme, we examine how images are differently produced and shared within global versus local populations and after each earthquake, with the idea that amplification “collectively instructs” what features of the event are most important. Third, we analyze how images from other locations, disasters, and time periods are appropriated as part of the “story” of the disaster event. We found differences in image popularity, with global twitterers emphasizing recovery and relief efforts in their diffusion of images, and locals emphasizing people suffering and major damage in their sourcing and re-sharing. We also found that globals were more likely to appropriate images, evoking lessons from Sontag about “the pain of others” [39].</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper examines social media use after a tragic disaster in a rural community in the United States—the 2014 Oso Landslide. Drawing upon interviews with community members and digital traces from multiple platforms, we explore how affected locals, government responders and journalists utilized a broad range of social media in their work—assembling different platforms to meet the information needs of their audiences. We borrow the analytical lens of stitching suggested by Vertesi, which allows us to see where these infrastructural alignments are seamless vs. seamful—highlighting some of the emergent and persistent challenges for those responding to disasters with and through social media. We demonstrate how this work is extremely dynamic, as the technical affordances of these platforms and the evolving practices of users shape how crisis communication occurs. Simultaneously, the pervasive and in some places institutionalized use of these platforms across a wide range of local actors suggests they are performing as critical infrastructure during crisis response. This raises questions of what it means to have so much local crisis information work occurring through platforms that mediate from a distance.</abstract>

      <abstract>Crowdsourcing platforms have become important information providers after disaster events. While they can build on some prior experiences, it is not yet well understood how contributor capacity for such activities is constituted. To what extent are initiatives building a dormant task force that springs to action when it is needed? Alternatively, do they mainly rely on the recruitment of new contributors during disaster events, possibly at the expense of contribution quality? We seek to develop a better understanding of these relationships, using the example of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team. In a large-scale quantitative study, we assess the outcomes of 26 campaigns with almost 20,000 participants. We find that event-centric campaigns can be significant recruiting and reactivation events, however that this is not guaranteed. Our analytical methods provide a means of interpreting key differences in outcomes. We close with recommendations relating to the promotion and coordination of event-centric campaigns in HOT and related platforms. </abstract>

      <abstract>Over the years online health communities (OHCs) have become an important source of information regarding health management and a place for social interaction and emotional support. Previous research suggested that these two types of social support have intricate and complex relationships. In this paper, we report on the results from a secondary analysis of qualitative interviews conducted during several studies examining how individuals make sense of the information collected within an online forum dedicated to diabetes self-management, TuDiabetes. The analysis suggested that informational and socio-emotional needs can at times complement each other, but can also lead to contradictory priorities and expectations for OHC members. Specifically, the study suggested that there are important tensions between these two positions in regards to appropriate topics and focus of conversations, the desire for homogeneity and diversity in opinions, the perceived importance of identifying authoritative voices, and the importance of personal and health-related information in contextualizing members’ posts. We discuss these tensions and draw implications for the design of future OHCs. </abstract>

      <abstract>Important work rooted in psychological theory posits that health behavior change occurs through a series of discrete stages. Our work builds on the field of social computing by identifying how social media data can be used to resolve behavior stages at high resolution (e.g. hourly/daily) for key population subgroups and times. In essence this approach opens new opportunities to advance psychological theories and better understand how our health is shaped based on the real, dynamic, and rapid actions we make every day. To do so, we bring together domain knowledge and machine learning methods to form a hierarchical classification of Twitter data that resolves different stages of behavior. We identify and examine temporal patterns of the identified stages, with alcohol as a use case (planning or looking to drink, currently drinking, and reflecting on drinking). Known seasonal trends are compared with findings from our methods. We discuss the potential health policy implications of detecting high frequency behavior stages.</abstract>

      <abstract>The growing amount of data collected by quantified self tools and social media hold great potential for applications in personalized medicine. Whereas the first includes health-related physiological signals, the latter provides insights into a user’s behavior. However, the two sources of data have largely been studied in isolation. We analyze public data from users who have chosen to connect their MyFitnessPal and Twitter accounts. We show that a user’s diet compliance success, measured via their self-logged food diaries, can be predicted using features derived from social media: linguistic, activity, and social capital. We find that users with more positive affect and a larger social network are more successful in succeeding in their dietary goals. Using a Granger causality methodology, we also show that social media can help predict daily changes in diet compliance success or failure with an accuracy of 77%, that improves over baseline techniques by 17%. We discuss the implications of our work in the design of improved health interventions for behavior change.</abstract>

      <abstract>Studying in-situ technology use over time can be difficult and this is especially so when considering technologies such as activity tracking devices explicitly designed to be unobtrusive. Yet understanding activity tracking in practice is crucial, as tracking technologies become important tools for health promotion and health insurance programs. In this paper, we describe a method for a longitudinal participant-driven photo elicitation study of activity tracking. During the five-month long study, our drop-out rates were low and we observed idiosyncratic practices with lapses and particular use patterns among participants along with significant self-reflection on activity tracking as a practice. We describe our method in detail, discussing the necessary adaptations for the study of activity tracking practices. We offer our experiences of benefits and challenges of this process, and suggest points for consideration for future studies in the area.</abstract>

      <abstract>People in recovery from substance use disorders seek peer support through online health communities like InTheRooms.com (ITR). This community provides the unique opportunity to study video-mediated health peer support online, as it hosts over 100 weekly video meetings for fellowships like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). We describe two synergistic investigations of participants’ use, perceptions, and tensions around video meetings on ITR: an online questionnaire, and in-depth inter-views with active site members. We discuss four themes that may be important to other peer-support health communities: opportunities for video-mediated support, synergy with face-to-face contact, challenge of transparency of norms, and the importance of constructive moderation. </abstract>

      <abstract>Barriers to accessing mental health care leave the majority of people with mental illnesses without professional care. Peer support has been shown to address gaps in care, and could scale to wider audiences through technology. But technology design for mental health peer support lags far behind tools for individuals and clinicians. To identify opportunities for design, we interviewed 18 people with a diverse range of mental illnesses about their use of technology for peer support, and invited them to design technologies that could improve their experience of peer support. We found that technology could enhance peer support for mental health by: (1) matching peers on similarities beyond diagnosis; (2) enhancing accessibility; and (3) proactively mitigating risk through training and intervention. We discuss these findings in the context of the broad peer support literature, and present design opportunities for making mental health peer support tools more empowering, accessible, and safe.</abstract>

      <abstract>People can benefit from disclosing negative emotions or stigmatized facets of their identities, and psychologists have noted that imagery can be an effective medium for expressing difficult emotions. Social network sites like Instagram offer unprecedented opportunity for image-based sharing. In this paper, we investigate sensitive self-disclosures on Instagram and the responses they attract. We use visual and textual qualitative content analysis and statistical methods to analyze self-disclosures, associated comments, and relationships between them. We find that people use Instagram to engage in social exchange and story-telling about difficult experiences. We find considerable evidence of social support, a sense of community, and little aggression or support for harmful or pro-disease behaviors. Finally, we report on factors that influence engagement and the type of comments these disclosures attract. Personal narratives, food and beverage, references to illness, and self-appearance concerns are more likely to attract positive social support. Posts seeking support attract significantly more comments. CAUTION: This paper includes some detailed examples of content about eating disorders and self-injury illnesses.</abstract>

      <abstract>Self-harm is the infliction of pain or injury onto oneself. Though historically these behaviors were relegated to the fringes of communities, information technology now enables new ways to foster and encourage these dangerous activities. This paper defines the concept of digital self-harm as the online communication and activity that leads to, supports, or exacerbates, non-suicidal yet intentional harm or impairment of an individual’s physical wellbeing. We outline a research agenda for the CSCW community to understand the correlation and possible causation of offline self-harm behaviors due to online activities, and to design and assess technologies focused on prevention, mitigation and treatment. CAUTION: This paper includes media that could potentially be triggering to those dealing with an eating disorder or with other self-harm related illnesses.

      <abstract>Data interoperation functions with the logic of a black box. Interoperation is achieved through front-loaded work and epistemically charged negotiation that thereafter become infrastructural, that is, supporting downstream actions without fully revealing the underpinnings that enable those actions.  Drawing from ethnographic and archival investigations of data interoperation within and across an ecology of HIV/AIDS research infrastructures, this paper offers several sensitizing concepts for the investigation of how data are brought together and thereafter circulate. Data interoperability is historical, infrastructural, relatively irreversible, negotiated, epistemic, seamful and seamless, and is approaching the status of a general value rather than a specific means to an end. </abstract>

      <abstract>This paper describes the use of the Delphi method as a means of incorporating study participants into the processes of data analysis and interpretation. As a case study, it focuses on perceptions about use and non-use of the social media site Facebook. The work presented here involves three phases. First, a large survey included both a demographically representative sample and a convenience sample. Second, a smaller follow-up survey presented results from that survey back to survey respondents. Third, a series of qualitative member checking interviews with additional survey respondents served to validate the findings of the follow-up survey. This paper demonstrates the utility of Delphi by highlighting the ways that it enables us to synthesize across these three study phases, advancing understanding of perceptions about social media use and non-use. The paper concludes by discussing the broader applicability of the Delphi method across CSCW research.</abstract>

      <abstract>Numerous crowdsourcing platforms are now available to support research as well as commercial goals.
However, crowdsourcing is not yet widely adopted by researchers for generating, processing or analyzing research data.  This study develops a deeper understanding of the circumstances under which crowdsourcing is a useful, feasible or desirable tool for research, as well as the factors that may influence researchers' decisions around adopting crowdsourcing technology.   We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 researchers in diverse disciplines, spanning the humanities and sciences, to illuminate how research norms and practitioners' dispositions were related to uncertainties around research processes, data, knowledge, delegation and quality.  The paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications for future crowdsourcing systems to support research.</abstract>

      <abstract>We introduce Inquire, a tool designed to enable qualitative exploration of utterances in social media and large-scale texts. As opposed to keyword search, Inquire allows the effective use of sentences as queries to quickly explore millions of documents to retrieve semantically-similar sentences. We apply Inquire to LiveJournal.com (LJ) database, which contains millions of personal diaries, and we use semantic embeddings trained in LJ or Google News (GN) datasets. We present the system design through iterative evaluations with qualitative researchers. We show how queries become a part of the inductive process, enabling researchers to try multiple ideas while gaining intuition and discovering less-obvious insights. We discuss the choice of LJ as a rich source of public posts, the preference for GN embeddings which link formal language (e.g. “reminiscence triggers”) with colloquial expressions (e.g. “music brings back memories”), the interplay between tool and user, and potential qualitative and social research opportunities.</abstract>

      <abstract>Increasing demands for senior care raise the challenge of how to support independence in older adults while assisting their health management. Most seniors would like to age in place, but concerns about safety lead many to move to a place that can provide basic care support, such as a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC). CCRCs provide different care levels for seniors, from independent living to nursing home. In this paper we examine how independent residents of a CCRC manage their health through a series of self-care and collaborative care activities. We interviewed 18 independent residents and five staff members of a CCRC. We have found that their care involves both external monitoring and self-care, and self-tracking is an integral part of self-care. These different forms of care are interconnected and complimentary. However, negative connotations associated with aging limit their effectiveness. Examining how these care practices function could inform the design of technology for a broader population of seniors aging in place.</abstract>

      <abstract>Most adult children take care of their parents as they become older. However, the way in which families articulate themselves to care for their older members depends on cultural and social factors, which are different across societies. Given these differences, the design of CSCW systems and related services to support informal elderly caregiving requires contextual understanding of the complex and diverse living experiences and needs of older adults. This paper presents a cross-generational study to better understand the cooperative nature of informal elderly caregiving in Chile and Argentina. The study results show that family members assume implicit roles to fulfill their duties, with practically no coordination and no visibility of the assumed commitments within the family network. This implies that the articulation of the elderly caregiving is inefficient, conflict prone, and unbalanced, where family members assume a separation of concerns based on gender and kinship relationship with the older adult.</abstract>

      <abstract>Prior research has drawn attention to numerous problems with ICTs designed for philanthropic contexts. Yet, little is known about how to support philanthropic work in its own right, especially as it transcends formal engagements with nonprofit organizations and suffuses everyday life. In this research, we draw on data from a 33-day mobile diary study augmented by follow-up interviews to examine the work of everyday philanthropy. By taking individuals’ philanthropic work—rather than a specific technology or its users—as our unit of analysis, we establish an empirical foundation for a new design space for philanthropic informatics. Our research shows that philanthropic work is not just about transactions of money, goods, or services. Instead, we argue that a lens of care work is a more useful framing of everyday philanthropy. We also draw renewed attention to the myriad roles of institutions beyond that of a resource intermediary.</abstract>

      <abstract>Collaborative patient-care teams rely on accurate and complete information in order to make informed decisions about their patients. However, patient-related information problems (PIPs) are a common occurrence in hospital work. These PIPs are any issues related to patient information that impact the patient-care team’s ability to perform their work (e.g., wrong, missing, outdated information). To better understand the challenges that patient-care teams face in identifying and collaboratively managing PIPs related to the use of the electronic health record (EHR), we conducted a qualitative study of patient-care teams during morning rounds. In this paper, we describe the types of PIPs that the team members encountered and how they identified who was accountable for fixing the PIP. Through our analysis, we highlight the challenges that arise when team members have an unclear or conflicting assumption about who is responsible for fixing the PIP. We conclude with a discussion on improving organizational policies and EHR design in order to help reduce ambiguous accountability for the management of PIPs within collaborative teams.</abstract>

      <abstract>A key issue, whenever people work together to solve a complex problem, is how to divide the problem into parts done by different people and combine the parts into a solution for the whole problem.  This paper presents a novel way of doing this with groups of contests called contest webs.  Based on the analogy of supply chains for physical products, the method provides incentives for people to (a) reuse work done by themselves and others, (b) simultaneously explore multiple ways of combining interchangeable parts, and (c) work on parts of the problem where they can contribute the most.  

The paper also describes a field test of this method in an online community of over 50,000 people who are developing proposals for what to do about global climate change. The early results suggest that the method can, indeed, work at scale as intended.

      <abstract>This paper describes how to find or filter high-quality ideas submitted by members collaborating together in online communities. Typical means of organizing community submissions, such as aggregating community or crowd votes, suffer from the cold-start problem, the rich-get-richer problem, and the sparsity problem. To circumvent those, our approach learns a ranking model that combines 1) community feedback, 2) idea uniqueness, and 3) text features—e.g., readability, coherence, semantics, etc. This model can then rank order submissions by expected quality, supporting community members in finding content that can inspire them and improve collaboration among members.

As illustrative example, we demonstrate the model on OpenIDEO—a collaborative community where high-quality submissions are rewarded by winning design challenges. We find that the proposed ranking model finds winning ideas more effectively than existing ranking techniques (comment sorting), as measured using both Discounted Cumulative Gain and human perceptions of idea quality. We also identify the elements of winning ideas that were highly predictive of subsequent success: 1) engagement with community feedback, 2) submission length, and 3) a submission's uniqueness. Ultimately, our approach enables community members and managers to more effectively manage creative stimuli created by large collaborative communities.</abstract>

      <abstract>With the increasing popularity of crowdsourcing and crowd computing, the question of how to select a well-performing crowd process for a problem at hand is growing ever more important. Prior work casted crowd process selection to an optimization problem, whose solution is the crowd process performing best for a user’s problem. However, existing approaches require users to probabilistically model aspects of the problem, which may entail a substantial investment of time and may be error-prone. We propose to use black-box optimization instead, a family of techniques that do not require probabilistic modelling by the end user. Specifically, we adopt Bayesian Optimization to approximate the maximum of a utility function quantifying the user’s (business-) objectives while minimizing search cost. Our approach is validated in a simulation and three real-world experiments. 
The black-box nature of our approach may enable us to reduce the entry barrier for efficiently building crowdsourcing solutions.

      <abstract>Distributed, parallel crowd workers can accomplish simple tasks through workflows, but teams of collaborating crowd workers are necessary for complex goals. Unfortunately, a fundamental condition for effective teams — familiarity with other members — stands in contrast to crowd work’s flexible, on-demand nature. We enable effective crowd teams with Huddler, a system for workers to assemble familiar teams even under unpredictable availability and strict time constraints. Huddler utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize for highly familiar teammates when individual availability is unknown. We first present a field experiment that demonstrates the value of familiarity for crowd teams: familiar crowd teams doubled the performance of ad-hoc (unfamiliar) teams on a collaborative task. We then report a two-week field deployment wherein Huddler enabled crowd workers to convene highly familiar teams in 18 minutes on average. This research advances the goal of supporting long-term, team-based collaborations without sacrificing the flexibility of crowd work.</abstract>

      <abstract>Providing indigenous communities with ICT tools and methods for collecting and sharing their Traditional Ecological Knowledge is increasingly recognised as an avenue for improvements in environmental governance and social-environmental justice. In this paper we show how we carried out a usability engineering effort in the “wild” context of the Congolese rainforest – designing, evaluating and iteratively improving novel collaborative data collection interfaces for non-literate forest communities that can subsequently be used to facilitate communication and information sharing with logging companies. Working in this context necessitates adopting a thoroughly flexible approach to the design, development, introduction and evaluation of technology and the modes of interaction it offers. We show that we have improved participant accuracy from about 75% towards 95% and provide a set of guidelines for designing and evaluating ICT solutions in “extreme circumstances” – which hold lessons for CSCW, HCI and ICT4D practitioners dealing with similar challenges.</abstract>

      <abstract>We present a study of internet use and its forced non-use
in Bangladesh. In light of current initiatives on state and
industry actors to improve internet access and bridge the
‘digital divide’ for underserved, under-resourced, and underrepresented
communities across the world, we offer a situated,
qualitative perspective on what the current state of internet
use looks like for select social groups in Bangladesh. We
analyze how a state-imposed ban attempted to effect the nonuse
of particular web-based services and how the affected
populations found or did not find workarounds in response.
We also discuss takeaways for researchers as well as industry
and state actors studying and working towards more equitable
access to the internet in the ‘developing’ world.</abstract>

      <abstract>People capture photos, audio recordings, video, and more on a daily basis, but organizing all these digital artifacts quickly becomes a daunting task. Automated solutions struggle to help us manage this data because they cannot understand its meaning. In this paper, we introduce Kurator, a hybrid intelligence system leveraging mixed-expertise crowds to help families curate their personal digital content. Kurator produces a refined set of content via a combination of automated systems able to scale to large data sets and human crowds able to understand the data. Our results with 5 families show that Kurator can reduce the amount of effort needed to find meaningful memories within a large collection. This work also suggests that crowdsourcing can be used effectively even in domains where personal preference is key to accurately solving the task.</abstract>

      <abstract>We introduce Zaturi, a system enabling parents to create an audio book for their babies by utilizing micro spare time at work. We define micro spare time at work as tiny fragments of time with low cognitive loads that frequently occur at work, such as waiting for an elevator. We show that putting together micro spare time at work helps a working parent (1) build a tangible symbol conveying his/her thoughts to the beloved baby and (2) develop his/her own feelings of parental achievement without compromising regular working hours. Zaturi lets the parent immediately be aware of micro spare time and provides a crafted interface to seamlessly record the book piece by piece, so that the baby can enjoy listening to the book recorded in the parent's own voice. Through an extensive design process, we characterize the notion of micro spare time and build a working prototype of Zaturi. We also report parents' perceptions and family reactions after a two-week deployment.</abstract>

      <abstract>Children grow up fast. Many parents want to capture the candid, fleeting moments of their young children’s lives to treasure later, but these moments are difficult to anticipate and to capture without disruption. Current technologies to address this are limited to indiscriminately capturing everything, or are dependent on parents’ presence and prescience to initiate capture and manually record the moment. To address these limitations, we introduce KidKeeper, a toy-like system to capture, select, and deliver everyday family memories with minimal effort and disruption to family life.  It uses an innovative approach to capture that we call “integrated capture,” that combines previous attempts to continuously capture family memories with the practice-oriented approach of “unremarkable computing” to embed capture capabilities unobtrusively into everyday activities. In our study, we explore how technologies like KidKeeper mediate and align the different interests and values of various family members, namely parents who want precious moments and children who want to play, towards accomplishing a family goal to capture memories of everyday life.</abstract>

      <abstract>Patient-generated data can allow patients and providers to collaboratively develop accurate diagnoses and actionable treatment plans. Unfortunately, patients and providers often lack effective support to make use of such data. We examine patient-provider collaboration to interpret patient-generated data. We focus on irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a chronic illness in which particular foods can exacerbate symptoms. IBS management often requires patient-provider collaboration using a patient's food and symptom journal to identify the patient's triggers. We contribute interactive visualizations to support exploration of such journals, as well as an examination of patient-provider collaboration in interpreting the journals. Drawing upon individual and collaborative interviews with patients and providers, we find that collaborative review helps improve data comprehension and build mutual trust. We also find a desire to use tools like our interactive visualizations within and beyond clinic appointments. We discuss these findings and present guidance for the design of future tools. </abstract>

      <abstract>Patients are often overwhelmed in their efforts to understand their illnesses and determine what actions to take. In this paper, we want to show why care is sometimes not co-managed well between clinicians and patients, and the necessary information is often not well coordinated. Through a 2.5-year field study of an adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) clinic, we show there are different experiences of temporal ordering, or temporalities, between clinicians and patients (and their caregivers). We also show that misalignments between these temporalities can seriously affect the articulation (coordination) and information work that must go on for people to co-manage their conditions with clinicians. As one example, information flows can be misaligned, as a result of differing temporalities, causing sometimes an overwhelming amount of information to be presented and sometimes a lack of properly contextualized information. We also argue that these misalignments in temporalities, important in medicine, are a general coordination problem.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper presents findings from a two-month comparative study involving a total of 36 participants using a social fitness application called HealthyTogether. Our aim was to understand whether and how patients with chronic diseases and healthy adults respond differently to social incentives, such as competition, cooperation, and accountability, and how these incentives could relate to their engagement in physical activities.  We found that community leaderboard served different goals: healthy adults mainly used it to compete with others, and patients used it to validate their normalcy. For the patients, pairing up with strong ties fostered fulfilling fitness goals, while exercising with strangers diminished them. This study shows that social fitness application design for patients should take into account their need for support from communities and close relationships. Furthermore, our findings point towards opportunities for leveraging and modifying existing social fitness applications for patients’ health management.</abstract>

      <abstract>Young adult cancer survivors—individuals in their 20’s and 30’s—must cope with complicated informational and emotional needs that differ from those of other age groups. Although young adult cancer survivors are resourceful in finding information and support to help meet those needs, they face three distinct, ongoing challenges during and after the cancer experience: (1) feeling isolated; (2) confronting a sense of mortality; and (3) struggling with changing body image and identity. We present empirical findings from qualitative interviews with young adult cancer survivors that demonstrate how these challenges change throughout the illness experience, complicating a survivor’s search for information and support. We also characterize the adaptive behaviors survivors employ to overcome these challenges. Given these findings, we suggest design implications for online spaces young adult survivors use to collaborate, as well as resources about privacy and self-presentation that can best support survivors in making decisions about shar-ing information. </abstract>

In this paper, we investigate how members' pre-joining connections with the subgroup predict their productivity and withdrawal after joining. Drawing insights from attachment theories in social psychology, we examine two types of pre-joining connections: \textit{identity-based} attachment (how much members' interests were aligned with the subgroup's topics) and \textit{bonds-based} attachment (how much members had interacted with other members of the subgroup). Analyses of 79,704 editors in 1,341 WikiProjects show that 1) both identity-based and bonds-based attachment increased editors' post-joining productivity and reduced their likelihood of withdrawal; 2) identity-based attachment had a stronger effect on boosting direct contributions to articles while bonds-based attachment had a stronger effect on increasing article and project coordination, and reducing member withdrawal.

      <abstract>Integrating new users into a community with complex norms presents a challenge for peer production projects like Wikipedia. We present The Wikipedia Adventure (TWA): an interactive tutorial that offers a structured and gamified introduction to Wikipedia. In addition to describing the design of the system, we present two empirical evaluations. First, we report on a survey of users, who responded very positively to the tutorial. Second, we report results from a large-scale invitation-based field experiment that tests whether using TWA increased newcomers' subsequent contributions to Wikipedia. We find no effect of either using the tutorial or of being invited to do so over a period of 180 days. We conclude that TWA produces a positive socialization experience for those who choose to use it, but that it does not alter patterns of newcomer activity. We reflect on the implications of these mixed results for the evaluation of similar social computing systems.</abstract>

      <abstract>This qualitative study examines privacy practices and concerns among contributors to open collaboration projects. We collected interview data from people who use the anonymity network Tor who also contribute to online projects and from Wikipedia editors who are concerned about their privacy to better understand how privacy concerns impact participation in open collaboration projects. We found that risks perceived by contributors to open collaboration projects include threats of surveillance, violence, harassment, opportunity loss, reputation loss, and fear for loved ones. We explain participants’ operational and technical strategies for mitigating these risks and how these strategies affect their contributions. Finally, we discuss chilling effects associated with privacy loss, the need for open collaboration projects to go beyond attracting and educating participants to consider their privacy, and some of the social and technical approaches that could be explored to mitigate risk at a project or community level.</abstract>

      <abstract>Effective disease monitoring provides a foundation for effective public health systems. This has historically been accomplished with patient contact and bureaucratic aggregation, which tends to be slow and expensive. Recent internet-based approaches promise to be real-time and cheap, with few parameters. However, the question of when and how these approaches work remains open.

We addressed this question using Wikipedia access logs and category links. Our experiments, replicable and extensible using our open source code and data, test the effect of semantic article filtering, amount of training data, forecast horizon, and model staleness by comparing across 6 diseases and 4 countries using thousands of individual models. We found that our minimal-configuration, language-agnostic article selection process based on semantic relatedness is effective for improving predictions, and that our approach is relatively insensitive to the amount and age of training data. We also found, in contrast to prior work, very little forecasting value, and we argue that this is consistent with theoretical considerations about the nature of forecasting. These mixed results lead us to propose that the currently observational field of internet-based disease surveillance must pivot to include theoretical models of information flow as well as controlled experiments based on simulations of disease.</abstract>

      <abstract>Most social media platforms are persistent in nature, enabling users to re-visit content at their discretion. Platforms with design features that support ephemeral communications, such as Snapchat, have become increasingly popular. During the course of our empirical study, we interviewed 15 Snapchat users about their experiences and practices. Our data reveal that Snapchat users experienced different types of loss, including media, meaning, and context loss, and developed workarounds to deal with those losses, including preemptive action and collaborative saving practices. Our findings revealed a conflict between the user’s expectation of the affordance the ephemeral platforms would provide, and the actions user’s followed.</abstract>

      <abstract>Previous work creating systems for collaborative search has mainly focused on solutions for the desktop. However, as the majority of web use moves to mobile phones, few systems have been created on this platform to support collaboration around search results. Mobile search is often a collaborative activity where the input of a group is sought before making a decision to purchase something, visit a venue, or book a ticket. However, currently search and messaging applications are separate, creating frustrating copy-and-paste interactions and uninformative blue links or OpenGraph cards in messages. We built the Search Messenger system to support both finding and sharing search results, in the form of rich, interactive cards, directly within a mobile messaging system. After building the system, we conducted a two-week field study exploring how 14 participants used the system in their daily lives. We report on our findings and implications for future mobile applications that embed functionality in messaging.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) is pervasive on the Internet. While there is a line of empirical research that studies Internet users' attitudes and privacy preferences of OBA, little is known about their actual understandings of how OBA works. This is an important question to answer because people often draw on their understanding to make decisions. Through a qualitative study  conducted  in  an  iterative  manner, we identify four “folk models” held by our participants about how OBA works and show how these models are either incomplete or inaccurate in representing common OBA practices.  We discuss how privacy tools can be designed to consider these folk models.  In addition, most of our participants felt that the information being tracked is more important  than  who  the  web  trackers  are.   This  suggests  the  potential for an information-based blocking scheme rather than a tracker-based blocking scheme used by most existing ad-blocking tools.</abstract>

      <abstract>Speech commenting systems have been shown to facilitate asynchronous online communication from educational discussion to writing feedback. However, the production of speech comments introduces several challenges to users, including overcoming self-consciousness and time consuming editing. In this paper, we introduce TypeTalker, a speech commenting interface that presents speech as a synthesized generic voice to reduce speaker self-consciousness, while retaining the expressivity of the original speech with natural breaks and co-expressive gestures. TypeTalker streamlines speech editing through a simple textbox that respects temporal alignment across edits. A comparative evaluation shows that TypeTalker reduces speech anxiety during live-recording, and offers easier and more effective speech editing facilities than the previous state-of-the-art interface technique. A follow-up study on recipient perceptions of the produced comments suggests that while TypeTalker’s generic voice may be traded-off with a loss of personal touch, it can also enhance the clarity of speech by refining the original speech’s speed and accent.</abstract>

      <abstract>Crowd-mapping is a form of collaborative work that empowers users to share geographic knowledge. Despite geographic information being intrinsically evolving, little research has so far gone into analysing maintenance practices in these domains. In this paper, we quantitatively capture maintenance dynamics in geographic crowd-sourced datasets, in terms of: the extent to which different maintenance actions are taking place, the type of spatial information that is being maintained, who engages in these practices and where. We apply this method to 117 countries in OpenStreetMap, one of the most successful examples of geographic crowd-sourced datasets. Furthermore, we explore what triggers maintenance, by means of an online survey to which 96 OpenStreetMap contributors took part. Our findings reveal that, although maintenance practices vary substantially from country to country in terms of how widespread they are, strong commonalities exist in terms of what metadata is being maintained, by whom, and what triggers them.</abstract>

      <abstract>Crowd work is typically limited to simple, context-free tasks because they are easy to describe and understand. In contrast, complex tasks require communication between the requester and workers to achieve mutual understanding, which can be more work than it is worth. This paper explores the notion of structured communication: using structured microtasks to support communication in the domain of complex writing. Our studies compare a variety of communication mechanisms with respect to the costs to the requester in providing information and the value of that information to workers while performing the task. We find that different mechanisms are effective at different stages of writing. For early drafts, asking the requester to state the biggest problem in the current write-up is valuable and low cost, while later it is more useful for the worker if the requester highlights the text that needs to be improved. These findings can be used to enable richer, more interactive crowd work than what currently seems possible. We incorporate the findings in a workflow for crowdsourcing written content using appropriately timed mechanisms for communicating with the crowd.</abstract>

      <abstract>Crowd workers are distributed and decentralized. While decentralization is designed to utilize independent judgment to promote high-quality results, it paradoxically undercuts behaviors and institutions that are critical to high-quality work. Reputation is one central example: crowdsourcing systems depend on reputation scores from decentralized workers and requesters, but these scores are notoriously inflated and uninformative. In this paper, we draw inspiration from historical worker guilds (e.g., in the silk trade) to design and implement crowd guilds: centralized groups of crowd workers who collectively certify each other’s quality through double-blind peer assessment. A two-week field experiment compared crowd guilds to a traditional decentralized crowd work model. Crowd guilds produced reputation signals more strongly correlated with ground-truth worker quality than signals available on current crowd working platforms, and more accurate than in the traditional model.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online freelancing marketplaces have grown quickly in recent years. In theory, these sites offer workers the ability to earn money without the obligations and potential social biases associated with traditional employment frameworks. In this paper, we study whether two prominent online freelance marketplaces - TaskRabbit and Fiverr - are impacted by racial and gender bias. From these two platforms, we collect 13,500 worker profiles and gather information about workers' gender, race, customer reviews, ratings, and positions in search rankings. In both marketplaces, we find evidence of bias: we find that gender and race are significantly correlated with worker evaluations, which could harm the employment opportunities afforded to the workers. We hope that our study fuels more research on the presence and implications of discrimination in online environments.</abstract>

      <abstract>Research on peer-production suggests that as participants choose what actions to perform, prototypical activity patterns emerge. Recent work characterized these patterns and demonstrated that informal emergent roles are highly stable. Nonetheless, we know little about the ways in which contributors take on and shed emergent roles. The objectives of this study are to: (a) delineate the temporal dynamics of participants’ emergent role taking behaviors, and (b) identify the motivations driving role-transition behaviors. Our study links motivation to role-transition behaviors within Wikipedia. Our first sample covered eleven years and 222,119 contributors, and was used to identify four categories of temporal role-taking behaviors, that differ in their mobility between emergent roles and across Wikipedia articles. Our second examination linked the motivations of 175 new participants to their subsequent role-taking activity over 14 months. Together, the two analyses reveal that role-taking categories can be distinguished based on participants’ motivational orientation (intrinsic/extrinsic and self/others-oriented). </abstract>

However, in this paper, we show that this article-as-concept assumption is problematic due to editors’ tendency to split articles into parent articles and sub-articles when articles get too long for readers (e.g. “Portland, Oregon” and “History of Portland, Oregon” in the English Wikipedia). In this paper, we present evidence that this issue can have significant impacts on Wikipedia-based studies and systems and introduce the sub-article matching problem. The goal of the sub-article matching problem is to automatically connect sub-articles to parent articles to help Wikipedia-based studies and systems retrieve complete information about a concept. We then describe the first system to address the sub-article matching problem. We show that, using a diverse feature set and standard machine learning techniques, our system can achieve good performance on most of our ground truth datasets, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.</abstract>

      <abstract>This methods paper details an approach for identifying the representativeness of content in a user generated content (UGC) system while also accounting for endogeneity bias. We leverage metadata from an independent content provider to generate sets of commercially viable terms presumed to be of interest to specific audiences linking those terms to UGC. We describe our method and heuristics at a level of detail allowing others to follow or modify it to study both content representativeness and content gaps in UGC systems. We illustrate the method by investigating how well the English language Wikipedia addresses the content interests of four sample audiences: readers of men’s and women’s periodicals, and readers of political periodicals geared toward either liberal or conservative ideologies. We also share preliminary findings from each case study to demonstrate our method.</abstract>

      <abstract>Large-scale discussions between many participants abound on the internet today, on topics ranging from political arguments to group coordination. But as these discussions grow to tens of thousands of posts, they become ever more difficult for a reader to digest. In this article, we describe a workflow called recursive summarization, implemented in our Wikum prototype, that enables a large population of readers or editors to work in small doses to refine out the main points of the discussion.  More than just a single summary, our workflow produces a summary tree that enables a reader to explore distinct subtopics at multiple levels of detail based on their interests. We describe lab evaluations showing that (i) Wikum can be used more effectively than a control to quickly construct a summary tree and (ii) the summary tree is more effective than the original discussion in helping readers identify and explore the main topics.</abstract>

      <abstract>Trust is essential for beginning and maintaining relationships online where assessing uncertainties and risks is difficult. While product delays have been shown to reduce trust in e-commerce settings, we understand little about the effect of delays on trust in the increasingly popular context of crowdfunding. In a mixed method study, we examine what factors influence backers’ trust in crowdfunding when rewards are delayed.  Based on in-depth interviews with crowdfunding participants, we found that a rich set of factors influenced backers’ trust including backers’ role identity and domain knowledge, backer’s research on a creator’s background, creators’ communication during delays, and duration of delays. To better understand the factors affecting delays, we conducted a regression analysis with 4,089 delayed projects and found that the funding goal, number of backers, percent raised, number of reward levels, and creator’s previous crowdfunding experience are associated with the duration of delay. We discuss design implications for managing delays and maintaining trust in crowdfunding. </abstract>

      <abstract>Medical crowdfunding helps patients receive financial support from their distributed social networks online. However, little is known about who the patient’s supporters are, what support they provide, and why. To address this, we interviewed fifteen people involved in medical crowdfunding, including both beneficiaries and supporters. We found that support networks were larger than beneficiaries expected, with strangers offering support. Supporters offered not only monetary but also volunteering contributions including campaign creation, promotion, and external support. However, the emphasis medical crowdfunding interfaces place on monetary contributions led to social issues. Beneficiaries’ close friends felt pressured to donate money they could not afford to give. And anyone promoting the campaign worried they would be judged for requesting money. To mitigate these concerns, we suggest making the variety of volunteering contributions more visible and discuss the design challenges of including such signals in existing systems. </abstract>

      <abstract>Social costs and limited reach inhibit our use of social capital to solicit help. However, individuals are not the only holders of social capital: groups also possess reputations and social capital, and are often prepared to vouch for their own members. In this paper, we design methods for mobilizing this collective social capital in sociotechnical systems, enabling an individual to ask a trusted group whether it is willing to invest its reputation in doing them a favor. We instantiate this concept with Founder Center, a web platform in which members of a local entrepreneurship accelerator ask the accelerator community to collectively make them introductions to potential funders. In a field experiment, enabling access to collective social capital in this community nearly doubled the odds of members making a social capital request. Requests fulfilled utilizing collective social capital were at least as effective as ones utilizing traditional interpersonal social capital.</abstract>

      <abstract>Personal assistants using a command-dialogue model of speech recognition, such as Siri and Cortana, have become increasingly powerful and popular for individual use. In this paper we explore whether similar techniques could be used to create a speech-based agent system which, in a group meeting setting, would similarly monitor spoken dialogue, pro-actively detect useful actions, and carry out those actions without specific commands being spoken. Using a low-fi technical probe, we investigated how such a system might perform in the collaborative work setting and how users might respond to them. We recorded and transcribed a varied set of nine meetings; to generate simulated lists of automated ‘action items’ which we asked the meeting participants to review retrospectively. The low rankings given on these discovered items are suggestive of the difficulty in applying personal assistant technology to the group setting, and we document the issues emerging from the study. Through observations, we explored the nature of meetings and the challenges they present for speech agents.

      <abstract>Awareness information in shared-workspace groupware is often ephemeral, and when users are interrupted or look away from the system, they can miss important information about others’ activities. These attentional disconnections are brief (generally less than ten seconds), are frequent in many work environments, and can occur for many reasons. In this paper, we provide visualization techniques that can help groupware users recover from these short absences. First, we provide a simple attention monitor that informs groupware systems whether a user is looking at the screen and whether the workspace is visible. Second, we provide a framework of catch-up techniques for visualizing missed activity – including highlighting, motion traces, and replay. We implemented these techniques in three applications that cover different communication methods and interaction speeds, and explored the use of the effects in three studies. Participants clearly saw the value of catch-up techniques, and although different techniques were preferred in different situations, nearly all users strongly preferred the catch-up techniques. Our work shows that helping users deal with periods of attentional disconnection can substantially improve the usability of real-time groupware systems.

      <abstract>Mixed presence collaboration involves remote collaboration between multiple collocated groups. This paper presents the design and results of a user study that focused on mixed presence collaboration using large-scale tiled display walls. The research was conducted in order to compare data synchronization schemes for multi-user visualization applications. Our study compared three techniques for sharing data between display spaces with varying constraints and affordances. The results provide empirical evidence that using data sharing techniques with continuous synchronization between the sites lead to improved collaboration for a search and analysis task between remotely located groups. We have also identified aspects of synchronized sessions that result in increased remote collaborator awareness and parallel task coordination. It is believed that this research will lead to better utilization of large-scale tiled display walls for distributed group work.</abstract>

      <abstract>As experts and expertise are increasingly distributed across distance, remote collaboration on physical tasks also becomes popular. Physical collaboration requires collaborators to produce and resolve references to physical objects unambiguously. We present a novel annotation system called AlphaRead that enables users to add and see readable annotations of physical objects, such as labels in letter, in a dynamic video-mediated workspace. Explicit support for object readability can help people coordinate language and vision for collaboration, and allow them to directly read out object labels as a way to make unambiguous references. Object readability as a resource of linguistic references can reduce the ambiguity and complexity associated with traditional methods of referential expressions such as deictic pronouns (“this” or “that”) or descriptions of object attributes. In a video-mediated collaboration study, by making objects referable with readable labels, we improved the communication efficiency over the alternative options of using raw video or video with non-readable annotations to collaborate. We also identified patterns of language behaviors that people exhibited with readable labels and discussed the implications to the design of collaboration support tools.</abstract>

      <abstract>Introducing data tracking of patients, doctors, medicine, or medical equipment holds promise to optimize workflows within hospitals. However, placing tracking devices and collecting data does not automatically translate into new workflows; instead, it requires careful considerations, knowledge about the activities tracked, and technical knowledge. In this paper, we study the interdisciplinary work involved when data tracking techniques are used to construe workflows within a real life work setting: architectural design of hospitals. We provide an ethnographic account from a unique study where two types of data tracking techniques were utilized in an existing hospital with the aim of informing the architectural design of a future hospital. The paper makes three contributions. First, we characterize the work involved in construing workflows based upon data tracking. Second, we discuss surveillance as an empirical category, which emerged in our study. Finally, we argue that to be able to construe workflows based upon data tracking, balancing the seamless boundary of privacy in work and surveillance in cooperation with the practitioners is of critical importance. Without support from the practitioners, data quality is at risk, and the resulting workflows might turn out ‘flawed’. </abstract>

      <abstract>Recent studies call for attention to the relevant work that non-clinical personnel do, not only to support clinical work, butalso to the overall healthcare information infrastructure. Basedon a case study of orderlies work in a major university hos-pital, we further investigate and characterize orderlies workwith particular focus on handover situations as these supportthe collaboration and continuous coverage of hospital workpractices. The case study involves interviews with orderliesand clinicians and a pilot study of a task management applica-tion. Based on our findings, we describe three different typesof handovers (clinical to non-clinical, non-clinical to clini-cal, and intra non-clinical), and highlight the challenges thatarise during the main tasks with handovers situations: patienttransport and patient mobilization. We discuss the importanceof establishing and sustaining a common ground, supportingthe alignment of tasks and negotiations, as well as enhancingthe patient contact within and among clinical and non-clinicalpersonnel. We also present a couple of design recommenda-tions to account for these challenges and handover types in thedesign of handover tools to support orderlies work practices.</abstract>

      <abstract>Patient–provider communication is crucial to the quality of patient care. To avoid communication breakdowns, existing studies often aim to improve patients’ health literacy or providers’ interpersonal communication skills. Little has been done to look at the interaction between the two parties or the situated health practices where the communication occurs. To understand the barriers and the underlying factors leading to challenges in the patient–provider communication, we conducted an ethnographic study with patients and providers in an emergency care setting. We report three different communication difficulties between patients and providers: 1) conflicting perceptions of how the ED functions, 2) different understandings of the alternative information sources available in the ED, and 3) different perceptions of what information is critical to ED care. Highlighting the importance of ED practice literacy and balanced information sources, we discuss design opportunities for systems to support effective patient–provider communication during emergency care.

      <abstract>Social systems and applications often rely on message triggers to promote, remind and even persuade people to perform certain actions. However, repeated exposure to these triggers can lead to boredom, annoyance and decreased engagement. While existing research suggests that diversification of trigger contents may mitigate these issues, no systematic way of introducing it has been proposed. This paper proposes two message diversification strategies based on the use of cognitive spaces: 1) target-diverse – using concepts cognitively close to the targeted action; and 2) self-diverse – using concepts cognitively close to the message’s recipient. Through a controlled experiment we found that the self-diverse strategy reduces annoyance and boredom from repeated exposure and that both strategies increase perceived informativeness and helpfulness of the triggers. In a subsequent 2-week long field deployment focused on assessing the effects of the self-diverse strategy, we found that this strategy results in higher activity completion through supporting awareness, providing more information, and making the triggers more personally relevant. These diverse triggers are perceived as motivators rather than simple reminders. We conclude with insights on how to design and generate diverse messages. </abstract>

      <abstract>Vernacular visualizations are visual representations of information created by and for non-expert users, in contrast to those developed by experts for specialized audiences. Research looking at everyday design practices and the democratization of innovation indicates that deeper understanding of non-expert design practices has a positive impact on technology development. This qualitative study focuses on the creation, use and dissemination of vernacular visualizations in a citizen science project. Findings from this research (1) map visualization practices in an established citizen science project, (2) contribute to theoretical understanding of the ways in which vernacular visualization practices support data-rich collaborative and coordinated work, and (3) suggest ways in which visualizations and visual resources can be evaluated in terms of their abilities to enrich coordination and communication in these contexts. </abstract>

      <abstract>Quantified self-experimentation with personal diets is a popular activity among health enthusiasts, diagnosed patients, as well as &quot;life hackers&quot; pursuing self-optimization goals. In this paper, we reflect on self-experimentation practices in the context of amateur citizen science communities. We report findings from 11 month-long qualitative fieldwork in a community of nutrition hobbyists experimenting with a powdered food substitute &quot;soylent&quot;. Our respondents customized the soylent powders to their personal needs, tracked their metabolic reactions to the diet, and discussed their findings with the online soylent user community. Although the data and knowledge sharing within the community positively impacted respondents' nutrition literacy, these activities created risks regarding their health safety and data privacy. We define soylent self-experimentation as a form of &quot;extreme citizen science&quot;. Based on the limitations identified in the soylent community, we suggest a set of design recommendations for extreme citizen science projects.</abstract>

      <abstract>In citizen science, volunteers collect and share data with researchers, other volunteers, and the public at large. Data shared in citizen science includes information on volunteer location or other sensitive personal information; yet, volunteers do not typically express privacy concerns. This study uses the framework of contextual integrity to understand privacy accounting in the context of citizen science, by analyzing contextual variables including roles; information types; data flows and transmission principles; and, uses, norms, and values. Findings show that uses, norms, and values—including core values shared by researchers and public volunteers, and the motivations of individual volunteers—have a significant impact on privacy accounting. Overall, citizen science volunteers and practitioners share and promote openness and data sharing over protecting privacy. Studying the context of citizen science offers an example of contextually-appropriate data sharing that can inform broader questions about research ethics in an age of pervasive data. Based on these findings, this paper offers implications for designing data and information flows and supporting technologies in public and voluntary data sharing projects.</abstract>

      <abstract>Online citizen science projects have been increasingly used in a variety of disciplines and contexts to enable large-scale scientific research. The successes of such projects have encouraged the development of customisable platforms to enable anyone to run their own citizen science project. However, the process of designing and building a citizen science project remains complex, with projects requiring both human computation and social aspects to sustain user motivation and achieve project goals. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of 48 citizen science projects to identify common features and functionality. Supported by online community literature, we use structured walkthroughs to identify different mechanisms used to encourage volunteer contributions across four dimensions: task visibility, goals, feedback, and rewards. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on citizen science design and the relationship between community and microtask design for achieving successful outcomes.

      <abstract>The rise of open platforms and public APIs has enabled more users of customizable software to customize by installing plugins or add-ons that are created and shared by others. Despite the prevalence of online customization sharing, we know little about how and why online customizations are shared. Through interviews with 20 users of four diverse systems who have extensive experience with sharing their customizations, we reveal the concept of customization sharing ecosystems. These ecosystems include multiple components for hosting customizations, discussing, and managing them; the ecosystems are sustained through users acting in a diverse set of roles (e.g., sharers, re-users, reviewers, problem reporters, requesters, helpers, publicizers, and packers). Our interviews also reveal motivations for creating and sharing customizations online which overlap considerably with those in open source software. Our findings highlight tradeoffs and design considerations in these ecosystems. </abstract>

      <abstract>A myriad of digital artifacts are routinely exchanged online. While previous studies suggest that these are sometimes considered to be gifts, CSCW has largely overlooked explicit digital gifting where people deliberately choose to give digital media as gifts. We present an interview study that systematically analyzes the nature of digital gifting in comparison to conventional physical gifting. A five-stage gift exchange model, synthesized from the literature, frames this study. Findings reveal that there are distinctive gaps in people’s engagement with the digital gifting process compared to physical gifting. Participants’ accounts show how digital gifts often involve less labor, are sometimes not perceived as gifts by the recipient and are rarely reflected on and reciprocated. We conclude by drawing out design implications for digital gifting services and rituals.</abstract>

      <abstract>Peer-to-peer indirect exchange services, such as sharing sites that facilitate the lending and borrowing of physical goods among neighbors (such as NeighborGoods and Peerby), have not been as widely adopted as direct exchange systems, such as peer-to-peer platforms that facilitate the exchange goods and services for money (such as Uber and Airbnb). In order to understand contributing factors to this lack of adoption, we examined attitudes towards and usage of peer-to-peer resource-sharing sites among 37 residents of New York City, 9 of whom had previously used a peer-to-peer sharing site. In addition, to more deeply understand the role of trust on willingness to lend, we also conducted a survey with 195 respondents. Our findings show that people expressed concerns about violating norms of the kinds of objects suitable for sharing, about potential risks involved with entrusting a possession to somebody else, and about a dearth of available items that would be useful. Building upon previous technology acceptance models, critical mass theory, and prior research on peer economies, we propose a technology acceptance model for indirect exchange systems that includes generalized trust and ease of coordination. </abstract>

      <abstract>Online peer-to-peer platforms like Airbnb allow hosts to list a property (e.g. a house, or a room) for short-term rentals. In this work, we examine how hosts describe themselves on their Airbnb profile pages. We use a mixed-methods study to develop a categorization of the topics that hosts self-disclose in their profile descriptions, and show that these topics differ depending on the type of guest engagement expected. We also examine the perceived trustworthiness of profiles using topic-coded profiles from 1,200 hosts, showing that longer self-descriptions are perceived to be more trustworthy. Further, we show that there are common strategies (a mix of topics) hosts use in self-disclosure, and that these strategies cause differences in perceived trustworthiness scores. Finally, we show that the perceived trustworthiness score is a significant predictor of host choice--especially for shorter profiles that show more variation. The results are consistent with uncertainty reduction theory, reflect on the assertions of signaling theory, and have important design implications for sharing economy platforms, especially those facilitating online-to-offline social exchange.</abstract>

      <abstract>Collaborative work supported by mobile applications has become more and more popular. Mobile collaboration in some cases needs to be conducted in an interactive way to allow the sharing of the requester screen with the collaborator. Existing interactive screen sharing techniques, however, may cause heavy network traffic and high latency and lack fine-grained control of the scope of collaboration. In this paper, we propose CollaDroid, a lightweight and UI Description based technique for interactive collaboration of Android applications. CollaDroid can automatically transform an Android application to a collaboration augmented application with which a requester can interactively collaborate with a remote collaborator by synchronizing UI (User Interface) content and events. The results of our experimental study show that CollaDroid is applicable for a large part of applications in the Android Market and can provide an efficient collaboration mechanism with low network traffic and latency. And the results of our user study show that the collaboration mechanism implemented by CollaDroid is well accepted by users.</abstract>

      <abstract>This paper studies how communication infrastructure is explored, examined, and evaluated by self-identifying `security researchers' at hacking conventions. We analyze mobile phone `security research' as a case of negotiating infrastructural repair. `Security research' seeks to re-negotiate with industry actors what `security' actually means, which technological `insecurities' need mending, which bugs, mistakes, and risks should be repaired. These negotiations are tense and contested because the relations between `security research' and industry reach across utterly different identities and commitments, spanning an \textit{arena} of repair. To investigate how `security research' situates itself in this arena, we analyze presentations about hacking mobile telephony that have been given at events organized by the Chaos Computer Club between 2000 and 2015. With the help of qualitative coding techniques, we examine the identities and commitments involved in `security research,' the agendas that `security research' pursues, and the ways in which it addresses and relates to industry actors. We interpret our findings in terms of \textit{friction}, highlighting how a social arena of mobile phone repair is constituted through difference, rather than despite it.</abstract>

      <abstract>Organizational factors influence the success of security initiatives in software development. Security audits and developer training can motivate development teams to adopt security practices, but their interplay with organizational structures and routines remains unclear. We studied how security consultancy affected organizational routines in a software development group. Security consultants tested their product, reported vulnerabilities, and delivered a security training. We followed the group during and after consultancy events. As a result of the consultancy, group members improved their understanding of security issues, but could not effect a change of routines within the given organizational structure. They handled vulnerabilities in a stabilization routine without changes in feature development, where security remained intangible. Interestingly, group members acknowledged an unfulfilled need for change but defended the structure inhibiting change. Security initiatives need to consider this interplay of structure and situated practice, and manage change in addition to providing expertise and tools.</abstract>

      <abstract>OT (Operational Transformation) is a consistency maintenance technique for real-time collaborative editors and a continuous topic of research in CSCW for over two-decades. One main challenge in OT research is to detect and resolve puzzles ─ characteristic collaboration scenarios or transformation cases in which an OT system may fail to produce consistent results. A long-standing open issue is whether we can find and solve all possible puzzles in OT systems supporting string-wise operations under well-defined consistency requirements. In this paper, we present our research that solves this open problem and a set of concrete string-wise transformation functions capable of solving all known puzzles and preserving well-defined consistency requirements. Our results contribute to the advancement of state-of-the-art of OT fundamental knowledge and technological innovation.</abstract>

      <abstract>Organizations deploy gamification in CSCW systems to enhance motivation and behavioral outcomes of users. However, gamification approaches often cause competition between users, which might be inappropriate for working environments that seek cooperation. Drawing on the social interdependence theory, this paper provides a classification for gamification features and insights about the design of cooperative gamification. Using the example of an innova-tion community of a German engineering company, we present the design of a cooperative gamification approach and results from a first experimental evaluation. The findings indicate that the developed gamification approach has positive effects on perceived enjoyment and the intention towards knowledge sharing in the considered innovation community. Besides our conceptual contribu-tion, our findings suggest that cooperative gamification may be beneficial for cooperative working environments and represents a promising field for future research.</abstract>

      <abstract>In this paper we explore immersive street-level integration of social media content into collaborative virtual 3D city environments on two levels: i) public, where the virtual environment is populated with relevant social media content (e.g. Twitter and Facebook feeds of shops, non-governmetal organizations, the City organization); and ii) personal, where the virtual user, through his/her avatar, is able to access his/her personal social media feeds while immersed in the virtual city. We conducted a qualitative anticipated user experience study with 14 participants in four focus groups, who were asked to create designs of how they imagined social networking services could be integrated into virtual city environments. Further, participants were asked to comment on two visual concepts created by researchers. Results show that people appreciate the concept of having virtual cities populated with up-to-date content from social media services, but linking their own social media accounts is a more complex issue.

      <abstract>Learning to see through data is central to contemporary forms of algorithmic knowledge production. While often represented as a mechanical application of rules, making algorithms work with data requires a great deal of situated work. This paper examines how the often-divergent demands of mechanization and discretion manifest in data analytic learning environments. Drawing on research in CSCW and the social sciences, and ethnographic fieldwork in two data learning environments, we show how an algorithm’s application is seen sometimes as a mechanical sequence of rules and at other times as an array of situated decisions. Casting data analytics as a rule-based (rather than rule-bound) practice, we show that effective data vision requires would-be analysts to straddle the competing demands of formal abstraction and empirical contingency. We conclude by discussing how the notion of data vision can help better leverage the role of human work in data analytic learning, research, and practice.</abstract>

Current interactions between management and workplace occupants are limited by the gap between experiences of (dis)comfort (i.e. individual preferences and perceptions) and the rigid objectivity of organisational policies and procedures such as static setpoint temperatures for indoor spaces. Our hypothesis is that pervasive sensor data that captures the indoor climate can provide an effective platform from which to more successfully communicate about comfort and energy use. Through a qualitative study with building managers and occupants, we show that while data does not necessarily resolve these tensions, it provides an engaging forum for a more inclusive building management process, and we outline directions for taking a more conversational approach in the design of comfort and energy-use interventions for the workplace.</abstract>

      <abstract>Recent research has demonstrated that (a) groups can be characterized by a collective intelligence (CI) factor that measures their ability to perform together on a wide range of different tasks, and (b) this factor can predict groups’ performance on other tasks in the future. The current study examines whether these results translate into the world of teams in competitive online video games where self-organized, time-pressured, and intense collaboration occurs purely online. In this study of teams playing the online game League of Legends, we find that CI does, indeed, predict the competitive performance of teams controlling for the amount of time played as a team. We also find that CI is positively correlated with the presence of a female team member and with the team members’ average social perceptiveness. Finally, unlike in prior studies, tacit coordination in this setting plays a larger role than verbal communication. </abstract>

      <abstract>Forming work teams involves matching people with complementary skills and personalities, but requires obtaining such data a priori. We introduce team dating, where people interact on brief tasks before working with a dedicated partner for longer, more complex tasks. We studied team dating through two online experiments. In Experiment 1, workers from a crowd platform independently wrote an ad slogan, discussed it with three consecutive people and evaluated their team date interactions. They then selected preferred teammates from a list showing average ratings for people they had dated and not dated. Results show that participants evaluated their dates based on evidence beyond externally judged slogan quality, and relied heavily on their dyad-specific judgments in selecting teammates. In Experiment 2, we replicated the individual and team dating tasks, and formed teams, either i) by honoring pairwise team dating preferences, ii) randomly from their pool of dates, or iii) randomly from those not dated. Results show that teams formed from preferred dates performed better on a final creative task compared to random dates or non-dates. Team dating provides a dynamic technique for forming ad hoc teams accounting for interpersonal dynamics. The initial interactions provided information that helped people select and work with an appropriate teammate.</abstract>

      <abstract>One particular problem CSCW and HCI scholars have sought to address through the design of collaborative systems is the issues associated with diversity and creativity. Diversity can promote creativity by exposing individuals to different perspectives and at the same time make it difficult for teams to leverage their differences to be more creative. This paper asserts that through the promotion of cooperation, collectivism will help ideation team members overcome the challenges associated with diversity and promote creativity. To examine this assertion, we conducted an experimental study involving 107 individuals in 33 idea-generation teams. Collectivism was promoted through priming. The results confirm our assertion: collectivism created conditions that facilitated creativity when teams were high in perceived diversity. Collectivism also facilitated more satisfaction among teammates by offsetting negative perceptions of diversity. These results offer new insights on collectivism, perceived diversity and creativity.</abstract>

      <abstract>Designing systems to support the social context of personal data is a topic of importance in CSCW, particularly in the area of health and wellness. The relational complexities and psychological consequences of living with health data, however, are still emerging. Drawing on a 12+ month ethnography and corroborating survey data, we detail the experiences of parents using Nightscout—an open source, DIY system for remotely monitoring blood glucose data—with their children who have type one diabetes. Managing diabetes with Nightscout is a deeply relational and (at times) contested activity for parent-caregivers, whose practices reveal the tensions and vulnerabilities of caregiving work enacted through data. As engagement with personal data becomes an increasingly powerful way people experience life, our findings call for alternative data narratives that reflect a multiplicity of emotional concerns and social arrangements. We propose the analytic lens of caring-through-data as a way forward.

      <abstract>Parenting is a complex and morally loaded endeavor, especially in our technologically saturated world. Popular culture, news articles, and children’s groups regularly suggest that parents should monitor and control children’s experiences with media. Parents are thus encouraged to establish clear rules around technology exposure, screen time, and access to content. HCI parenting research tends to reflect these general messages and often assumes that media ‘rules’ are the norm, or at least the goal, in families. Through a two-year ethnographic study of nine families we find that the presence of technology rules is not as straightforward as literature and mainstream media suggest. In particular, our data proposes that media rules are highly variable across and within families, regularly undermined in practice, and more often around exposure than content. Further, we find that the impetuses for various family policies around media use are related to how rules are enacted in practice. Given the loaded emotional stakes that parents in this study place on negotiating media use and exposure, we argue that it is important for designers to take a more situated perspective on parenting practices.

      <abstract>Parent-child communication is an essential element in behavioral and character development in early childhood; however, parents may find it difficult to be aware of how they talk to their children. Through extensive field studies with experts and parents, we found that parents are more likely to experience communication conflict with preschool children (3-6 years old) on school mornings. In consultation with domain professionals and families, we designed WAKEY, a technology-based approach that helps parents use better communication strategies to teach preschool children to carry out their morning routines. Following the intervention with WAKEY, parents reported significantly reduced levels of frustration during morning routines and greater independent behavior by children. Furthermore, parents reported experiencing changes in their parenting attitudes and finding new insights into communication.</abstract>

      <abstract>In families composed of parents and children, the health of parents and children is often interrelated: the health of children can have an impact on the health of parents, and vice versa. However, the design of health tracking technologies typically focuses on individual self-tracking and self‑management, not yet addressing family health in a unified way. To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family‑centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self‑tracking to family-centered health tracking.</abstract>
